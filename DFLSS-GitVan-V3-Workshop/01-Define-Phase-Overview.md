# DMEDI Phase 1: Define

## Overview of the Define Phase

The **Define** phase is the critical first step in the DMEDI methodology. The primary objective is to clearly and unambiguously define the project's purpose, scope, and goals. A well-defined project is the foundation for a successful outcome. If the problem and goals are not clearly defined, the team risks delivering a product or process that fails to meet customer needs or business requirements.

For a software project like GitVan v3, the Define phase is analogous to the initial stages of product management and project planning, where the vision is translated into an actionable plan.

### Key Objectives of the Define Phase:

1.  **Identify the Business Opportunity:** Why are we doing this project? What is the problem we are trying to solve or the opportunity we are trying to capture?
2.  **Define the Project Scope:** What are the boundaries of the project? What is in scope and, just as importantly, what is out of scope?
3.  **Establish Project Goals:** What are the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for the project?
4.  **Identify Stakeholders:** Who are the customers, users, and internal stakeholders? What are their expectations?
5.  **Create a High-Level Project Plan:** Outline the major milestones, timeline, and resources required.
6.  **Assess Risks:** Identify potential risks to the project and develop initial mitigation strategies.

### GitVan v3.0 Case Study Application

In the context of the GitVan v3.0 project, the Define phase involves formalizing the vision of "Autonomic Intelligence." The team needs to move from this high-level concept to a concrete project definition.

We will use the following tools and deliverables to complete the Define phase for GitVan v3:

*   **Project Charter:** A formal document that authorizes the project and outlines its objectives, scope, stakeholders, and high-level plan.
*   **Multi-Generational Project Plan (MGPP):** A roadmap that shows how the v3.0 release fits into the longer-term evolution of the GitVan product.
*   **Risk Management Plan:** An initial assessment of the key risks (technical, market, execution) and a plan to manage them.
*   **Communication Plan:** A plan for how the project team will communicate with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.

By the end of this phase, we will have a clear and shared understanding of what we are building, why we are building it, and how we will measure success. This clarity is essential before we proceed to the **Measure** phase, where we will dive deep into the specific needs of the customer.
