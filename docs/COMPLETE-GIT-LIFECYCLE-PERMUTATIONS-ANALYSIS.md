## 🎯 Comprehensive Test Plan Requirements

To achieve 100% coverage, we need to test:

1. **All 18 Git hooks** (currently 12/18 implemented)
2. **All 27 non-hook Git operations** (currently 0/27 implemented)
3. **All 100+ permutations** of Git operations
4. **All combinations** of operations
5. **All edge cases** and error conditions
6. **All repository states** (clean, dirty, conflicted, etc.)
7. **All branch states** (ahead, behind, diverged, etc.)
8. **All file states** (staged, unstaged, untracked, etc.)

## 🚨 Critical Gaps Identified

### **Missing Hooks (6/18)**
1. **applypatch-msg** - Before applying a patch
2. **pre-applypatch** - Before applying a patch
3. **post-applypatch** - After patch is applied
4. **post-update** - After remote repository is updated
5. **push-to-checkout** - When push updates currently checked-out branch
6. **pre-merge-commit** - Before merge commit is created

### **Missing Operations (27/45)**
1. **git reset** (soft, mixed, hard)
2. **git revert**
3. **git stash** / **git stash pop**
4. **git tag** (creation/deletion)
5. **git branch** (creation/deletion)
6. **git clean**
7. **git cherry-pick**
8. **git pull**
9. **git fetch**
10. **git clone**
11. **git init**
12. **git add**
13. **git rm**
14. **git mv**
15. **git status**
16. **git log**
17. **git diff**
18. **git show**
19. **git blame**
20. **git bisect**
21. **git rebase** (interactive)
22. **git merge** (various strategies)
23. **git checkout** (detached HEAD)
24. **git reflog**
25. **git fsck**
26. **git gc**
27. **git prune**

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Implement missing 6 hooks**
2. **Implement detection for 27 non-hook operations**
3. **Create comprehensive test suite for all 100+ permutations**
4. **Test all combinations and edge cases**
5. **Achieve 100% Git lifecycle coverage**

This analysis reveals that we need to consider **ALL 45 Git operations** and **ALL 100+ permutations** to achieve complete coverage, not just the 12 hooks currently implemented.
