# GitVan v2 Security Model

GitVan v2 is built with security-first principles, providing enterprise-grade protection for automated workflows and AI-powered development operations.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Sandboxed Execution**: All job execution happens in isolated, ephemeral containers
- **Minimal Permissions**: Jobs run with least-privilege access patterns
- **Network Isolation**: Controlled network access with explicit allow-lists
- **Resource Constraints**: CPU, memory, and storage limits prevent resource exhaustion

### 2. Cryptographic Integrity
- **Signed Commits**: All automated commits are cryptographically signed
- **Receipt Generation**: Immutable execution receipts stored in Git notes
- **Chain of Custody**: Verifiable audit trail from trigger to completion
- **Content Verification**: Checksums and signatures for all artifacts

### 3. Secure-by-Default Configuration
- **Environment Isolation**: Secrets never exposed to job environments
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative security settings out-of-the-box
- **Explicit Permissions**: All capabilities must be explicitly granted
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers with fail-safe mechanisms

## Security Architecture

    E --> H[External APIs]
    F --> I[Process Management]
    G --> J[Signed Commits]
    H --> K[Audit Logs]
    I --> L[Resource Monitoring]
```

### Secret Management

GitVan v2 implements a sophisticated secret management system:

- **Encrypted Storage**: Secrets encrypted at rest using AES-256
- **Runtime Injection**: Secrets injected only at job execution time
- **Scope Isolation**: Secrets scoped to specific repositories/workflows
- **Rotation Support**: Automated secret rotation with zero-downtime
- **Audit Trail**: Complete log of secret access and usage

### Access Control Model

```yaml
# Repository-level access control
repository:
  permissions:
    read: [team:developers, user:ci-bot]
    write: [team:maintainers]
    admin: [team:security, user:repo-owner]

# Job-level access control
job:
  permissions:
    execute: [role:ci-runner]
    debug: [role:developer]
    cancel: [role:maintainer]

# Secret-level access control
secrets:
  permissions:
    read: [job:production-deploy]
    write: [role:admin]
    rotate: [role:security]
```

## Sandboxed Execution

### Container Security
- **Rootless Containers**: Jobs run as non-root users
- **Read-only File System**: Immutable base container image
- **No Privileged Access**: No elevated permissions or capabilities
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated network namespace per job

### Resource Limits
```yaml
sandbox:
  resources:
    cpu: "1000m"        # 1 CPU core maximum
    memory: "2Gi"       # 2GB RAM maximum
    storage: "10Gi"     # 10GB disk maximum
    network: "100Mbps"  # Bandwidth limit

  timeouts:
    execution: "30m"    # Maximum job runtime
    idle: "5m"          # Idle timeout
    cleanup: "2m"       # Cleanup timeout
```

### File System Isolation
- **Temporary Workspace**: Ephemeral file systems destroyed after execution
- **No Host Access**: Cannot access host file system
- **Secure Mounts**: Only necessary directories mounted read-only
- **Content Scanning**: All file operations scanned for malicious content

## Audit Trails with Git Notes

GitVan v2 maintains comprehensive audit trails using Git's native notes feature:

### Execution Receipts
```json
{
  "execution_id": "exec_2024_001",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "schedule",
    "source": "main:workflows/ci.yml",
    "user": "system"
  },
  "environment": {
    "container_id": "sha256:abc123...",
    "runtime_version": "gitvan-v2.1.0",
    "resource_usage": {
      "cpu_time": "120s",
      "memory_peak": "1.2GB",
      "disk_usage": "45MB"
    }
  },
  "changes": [
    {
      "file": "src/components/Button.tsx",
      "action": "modified",
      "lines_added": 12,
      "lines_removed": 3,
      "checksum": "sha256:def456..."
    }
  ],
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "Ed25519",
    "public_key": "gitvan-runner-key-001",
    "signature": "base64-encoded-signature"
  }
}
```

### Audit Note Structure
```bash
# Git notes namespace for audit trails
refs/notes/gitvan/executions    # Execution receipts
refs/notes/gitvan/security      # Security events
refs/notes/gitvan/compliance    # Compliance records
refs/notes/gitvan/approvals     # Human approvals
```

## Signed Commits and Receipts

### Commit Signing
All automated commits are cryptographically signed:

```bash
# Example signed commit
commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b
Author: GitVan Runner <runner@gitvan.dev>
Date: Mon Jan 15 14:30:00 2024 +0000
Signature: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
 iQIzBAABCAAdFiEE...
 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

    feat: auto-generated component updates
