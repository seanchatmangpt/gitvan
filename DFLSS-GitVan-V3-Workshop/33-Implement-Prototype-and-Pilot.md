# Implement: Prototype and Pilot

## The Role of Prototyping and Piloting in Software

In the Implement phase, before a full-scale launch, we must test our design in a real-world environment. This is done through prototyping and piloting.

*   **Prototype:** A prototype is an early, often incomplete, version of a product built to test a concept or assumption. In software, this could be a clickable wireframe, a proof-of-concept for a new algorithm, or a single feature built out for user testing.

*   **Pilot (or Beta):** A pilot is a limited release of the final, feature-complete product to a select group of real users. The goal is to validate the product's performance, usability, and stability in a production environment before making it generally available.

This iterative feedback loop is critical for de-risking a major launch.

## GitVan v3.0 Case Study: The Beta Program

The GitVan v3.0 Release Plan explicitly calls for a beta program. This is the DFLSS "Pilot" for the project.

**From the Release Plan:**
> **Launch Campaign:**
> 1.  **Beta Program:** 100 beta users, 3 months before release

### Designing the Pilot Program

A successful pilot program requires careful planning.

**1. Goals of the Pilot:**
*   **Validate Performance:** Does the product meet the SLOs for latency and availability under real-world load?
*   **Gather Usability Feedback:** How do users interact with the new features, especially the AI workflow generation? Is it intuitive?
*   **Identify Bugs:** Find and fix critical bugs that were not caught in internal testing.
*   **Test the Onboarding Experience:** Is the setup process as seamless as we designed it to be (< 30 seconds)?

**2. Participant Selection:**
*   The team will recruit 100 developers.
*   **Segmentation:** To ensure diverse feedback, they will recruit a mix of users:
    *   50 existing GitVan v2 power users.
    *   30 developers who use competing automation tools.
    *   20 developers who are new to Git automation.
*   This segmentation allows them to test feedback from different user personas.

**3. Pilot Execution Plan:**
*   **Duration:** 3 months.
*   **Environment:** The beta will be a production-ready build of GitVan v3, but it will be clearly marked as a beta version.
*   **Feedback Channels:** A private Discord server will be created for beta users to share feedback, report bugs, and interact with the development team directly.
*   **Data Collection:** The team will collect both qualitative and quantitative data:
    *   **Qualitative:** User interviews, session recordings, and direct feedback from Discord.
    *   **Quantitative:** Application telemetry (feature usage, performance metrics, error rates) and regular surveys (e.g., Net Promoter Score, System Usability Scale).

**4. Success Criteria for the Pilot:**

Before launching the pilot, the team defines what success looks like. These are the exit criteria for moving to a full launch.

*   **Performance:** All P0 SLOs must be met for 99.9% of users for 4 consecutive weeks.
*   **Stability:** No more than 5 unique P0 (showstopper) bugs reported in the final month of the beta.
*   **Satisfaction:** Achieve a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of > 80 (which is considered excellent).
*   **Adoption:** At least 60% of the beta users are still actively using the product at the end of the 3-month period.

### From Pilot to Launch

The pilot program is not just a test; it's a critical gate in the implementation process. The data and feedback gathered during the beta will be used to make the final go/no-go decision for the public launch.

*   **If Success Criteria are Met:** The team can proceed with the full public launch with high confidence that the product is ready for the market.
*   **If Success Criteria are Not Met:** The team must address the gaps. This might involve another round of development to fix critical bugs or improve performance, followed by an extension of the beta program. This prevents a premature and potentially disastrous public launch.

By using a structured pilot program, the GitVan v3 team minimizes the risk of a failed launch and ensures that the product they ultimately release has been validated by real users in a real-world environment.
