# Introduction to Design for Lean Six Sigma (DFLSS)

## Welcome to the Black Belt Course

Welcome to this advanced two-week course on Design for Lean Six Sigma (DFLSS). This curriculum is designed for prospective Black Belts who want to master the principles of designing new products and processes that are efficient, effective, and customer-focused from the start.

We will follow the **DMEDI** methodology, a structured framework for driving innovation and ensuring that new designs meet and exceed customer expectations. The five phases are:

1.  **Define:** Define the project goals and customer deliverables.
2.  **Measure:** Measure and determine customer needs and specifications.
3.  **Explore:** Explore and select the best design concepts.
4.  **Develop:** Develop the detailed design for the new product or process.
5.  **Implement:** Implement the design and verify its performance.

## Case Study: The GitVan v3.0 "Autonomic Intelligence" Project

Throughout this course, we will use a single, comprehensive case study: **the development and launch of GitVan v3.0**.

GitVan is a sophisticated, AI-driven development automation platform. The v3.0 release, codenamed "Autonomic Intelligence," represents a transformative leap for the product. It aims to evolve GitVan from a powerful tool into an autonomous development partner that learns from and adapts to user workflows.

### The Knowledge Hooks Paradigm

The core of GitVan v3.0 is a new computing primitive: **Knowledge Hooks**. This paradigm shift is what enables "Autonomic Intelligence."

*   **Traditional hooks** are simple event-action triggers.
*   **Knowledge hooks** are far more powerful: they are `event + predicate + action`. The predicate is a question asked against a vast body of real-world knowledge.

This knowledge can come from anywhere: code, the repository, issue trackers, monitoring systems, business intelligence feeds, IoT sensors, or any other API.

This changes everything. Automation no longer runs blindly. It runs only when conditions match the real-world state. Git evolves from simple storage into a true runtime environment.

The architecture follows a clear pattern:

1.  **Turtle:** Workflows are defined in Turtle, a developer-friendly RDF format.
2.  **SPARQL:** Queries are written in SPARQL to extract the necessary data from the knowledge base.
3.  **JavaScript Object:** The results are formed into a JavaScript object.
4.  **Execution:** The JavaScript object is executed to perform the action.

The result is a system where workflows are both machine-verifiable and easy for developers to understand.

This approach is guided by Lean Six Sigma principles, focusing on the 20% of hooks and feeds that deliver 80% of the value. The "dark matter" hooks that provide the most leverage are `commit`, `push`, `merge`, and scheduled feeds. The most valuable non-Git knowledge sources are issue trackers, CI/CD pipelines, vulnerability scanners, monitoring data, chat platforms, and documentation.

By unifying Development, Operations, Security, and Business Intelligence under this single abstraction, Knowledge Hooks eliminate downstream waste like broken builds, failed deployments, and compliance misses. The JTBD (Jobs-to-be-Done) system has proven the coverage with 25 enterprise hooks and 5 orchestrators, all with 100% test pass rates.

The strategic implication is profound: GitVan inserts intelligence directly at the boundary of the source-of-truth. Prototypes and even resumes can be generated as artifacts directly from the repository. This represents a paradigm shift from reactive scripts to proactive, knowledge-driven automation.

### Why GitVan v3.0?

This project serves as an ideal case study for DFLSS because it involves:

*   **A new product vision:** Moving from automation to autonomy is a significant design challenge.
*   **Complex customer needs:** Developers have high expectations for their tools. The "Voice of the Customer" is critical.
*   **Advanced technology:** The project incorporates AI, a new workflow engine, and a "Git-native" architecture, presenting numerous design trade-offs.
*   **Process and product design:** We will analyze both the design of the GitVan v3 software (the product) and the design of the development and release processes used to build it.
*   **Rich data environment:** As a software project, we have access to performance metrics, usage data, bug reports, and test results that we can use for statistical analysis.

You will act as the Lean Six Sigma team embedded within the GitVan v3 project. Your mission is to apply the DMEDI toolkit at each stage to ensure the project is a success, delivering maximum value to customers while meeting business goals.

Let's begin by defining the project.
