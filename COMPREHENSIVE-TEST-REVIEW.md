## Detailed Test Review (Chronological Order)

### **PHASE 1: Foundation Tests (January 15, 2025 - First Commit)**

#### 1. `./cli.test.mjs` - **Rating: 9/10** ✅ **EXCELLENT**
**Analysis:**
- **Production Critical:** Main user interface - CLI commands
- **Real Integration Testing:** Uses actual `execSync` calls to test CLI behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests all major CLI commands (help, job, event, schedule, worktree, daemon)
- **Proper Setup/Teardown:** Creates temporary directories, initializes Git repos, cleans up
- **Error Handling:** Tests unknown commands, malformed files, missing configs
- **Well Structured:** Clear test organization with proper describe blocks
- **Deterministic:** Uses consistent test data and environment
- **Honest Testing:** Acknowledges incomplete features with comments

**Issues:** Some commented-out assertions for incomplete features
**Recommendation:** **KEEP** - This is a model test file for CLI testing.

#### 2. `./composables.test.mjs` - **Rating: 2/10** ❌ **SKIP/REPLACE**
**Analysis:**
- **SKIPPED TESTS:** `describe.skip` means these tests don't run at all
- **Mock Heavy:** Heavily mocked, not testing real functionality
- **Incomplete Implementation:** Many tests have commented-out assertions
- **No Real Validation:** Tests check function existence but not behavior
- **Outdated:** Appears to be from early development phase
- **No Production Value:** Tests don't actually validate anything

**Issues:** Tests are completely skipped, heavily mocked without real functionality testing
**Recommendation:** **REPLACE** - This test file is useless. Need real composable tests that actually run and validate functionality.

#### 3. `./tests/cli.test.mjs` - **Rating: 6/10** ⚠️ **REVIEW**
**Analysis:**
- **Different Approach:** Uses hybrid test environment instead of real execSync
- **MemFS Testing:** Tests CLI operations with in-memory filesystem
- **Not Real CLI Testing:** Doesn't actually test CLI commands, just Git operations
- **Misleading Name:** Called "CLI Tests" but doesn't test CLI commands
- **Limited Value:** Tests Git operations, not CLI functionality

**Issues:** Doesn't actually test CLI commands, uses MemFS instead of real CLI testing
**Recommendation:** **REVIEW** - This is not actually CLI testing. Either rename to Git operations test or implement real CLI testing.

#### 4. `./tests/composables.test.mjs` - **Rating: 7/10** ✅ **KEEP**
**Analysis:**
- **Real Testing:** Actually runs tests (not skipped like root version)
- **Hybrid Environment:** Uses MemFS for testing composables
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests useGit, useTemplate, useExec
- **Real Git Operations:** Tests actual Git functionality
- **Better Implementation:** Much better than the skipped root version

**Issues:** Uses MemFS instead of real filesystem, may not catch all real-world issues
**Recommendation:** **KEEP** - This is a much better implementation than the root version. Use this instead of the skipped root version.

#### 5. Tracer System Tests (5 files) - **Rating: 6/10** ⚠️ **REVIEW**
**Files:** `tests/tracer/config.test.mjs`, `tests/tracer/context.test.mjs`, `tests/tracer/git.test.mjs`, `tests/tracer/hooks.test.mjs`, `tests/tracer/router.test.mjs`, `tests/tracer/template.test.mjs`

**Analysis:**
- **System Testing:** Tests tracer system components
- **May Be Outdated:** Tracer system may be superseded by newer systems
- **Mixed Quality:** Some tests use hybrid environment instead of real testing
- **Need Verification:** Need to check if tracer system is still active in GitVan
