# AI Chat Workflows

GitVan v2's AI chat interface revolutionizes how you create and manage Git workflows through natural language conversation. Build complex automation through intuitive dialogue with your local AI assistant.

## 🗣 Conversational Job Generation

Transform natural language requirements into production-ready GitVan jobs through interactive chat sessions.

### Basic Chat Interface

#### Starting a Chat Session
```bash
# Start interactive AI chat
gitvan ai chat

# Chat with specific context
gitvan ai chat --context "repository automation"

# Chat with predefined goals
gitvan ai chat "I need to automate my release process"
```

#### Chat Commands
```bash
# Within chat session:
> Create a job that generates release notes from commits
> Refine it to include contributor information
> Add error handling for malformed commits
> Show me the final job code
> Save this job as release-notes-generator
```

### Advanced Conversation Patterns

#### Multi-Step Job Creation
```bash
gitvan ai chat
> I need a sophisticated deployment pipeline

AI: I'll help you create a deployment pipeline. Let me ask a few questions:
1. What's your target environment? (staging, production, both)
2. Do you use containers or direct deployment?
3. Should it run tests before deployment?
4. Any specific deployment triggers?

> Target both staging and production
> We use Docker containers
> Yes, run full test suite first
> Trigger on version tag creation

AI: Perfect! I'll create a multi-job pipeline for you...
```

#### Iterative Refinement
```bash
> Create a changelog generator

AI: [Generates basic changelog job]

> Make it more sophisticated - categorize commits by type
> Add support for conventional commits
> Include breaking change detection
> Format output as GitHub-flavored markdown

AI: [Refines job with requested features]

> Perfect! Now add a job that posts this to Slack
```

### Template-Driven Generation

#### Using Built-in Templates
```bash
# Generate with specific template
gitvan ai chat --template job-writer
> Create a security audit job that scans for vulnerabilities

# Use event template
gitvan ai chat --template event-writer
> Trigger on pull request creation to run code quality checks

# Use changelog template
gitvan ai chat --template changelog
> Generate release notes for version 2.1.0
```

#### Custom Template Creation
```bash
# Create template through chat
gitvan ai chat --mode template
> Create a template for API documentation jobs
> Include sections for endpoints, parameters, and examples
> Support multiple output formats (markdown, JSON, HTML)

AI: [Generates custom template]
> Save this template as api-docs-generator
```

## 🚀 Workflow Automation Patterns

### Release Management Workflows

#### Automated Release Notes
```bash
gitvan ai chat
> I need automated release notes that:
> - Parse conventional commits since last release
> - Categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking)
> - Include contributor list with GitHub handles
> - Generate both GitHub release and CHANGELOG.md
> - Post summary to team Slack channel

AI: I'll create a comprehensive release workflow with multiple jobs:

1. **Commit Parser Job**
   - Parses commits since last tag
   - Extracts conventional commit info
   - Categorizes by type

2. **Release Notes Generator**
   - Creates formatted release notes
   - Updates CHANGELOG.md
   - Generates GitHub release

3. **Notification Job**
   - Posts to Slack with summary
   - Includes links and metrics

Would you like me to create these jobs?

> Yes, create all three jobs
```

#### Semantic Versioning Automation
```bash
gitvan ai chat
> Create a job that automatically bumps version based on commit types
> - patch for fixes
> - minor for features
> - major for breaking changes
> - update package.json and create git tag

AI: [Creates semantic versioning job with detailed logic]

> Also add a job to generate migration guides for major versions
```

### Development Workflow Automation

#### Code Review Assistance
```bash
gitvan ai chat --context "code-review"
> Create jobs that help with code reviews:
> - Generate PR summary from diff
> - Create review checklist based on changed files
> - Identify potential security issues
> - Suggest test coverage improvements

AI: I'll create a code review automation suite:

1. **PR Analysis Job**
   - Analyzes diff complexity
   - Suggests review approach
   - Identifies risk areas

2. **Security Scanner Job**
   - Scans for common vulnerabilities
   - Checks dependency updates
   - Flags sensitive data patterns

3. **Test Coverage Job**
   - Analyzes test coverage gaps
   - Suggests test scenarios
   - Generates test templates

> Perfect! Also add a job that tracks review metrics
```

#### Development Diary Generation
```bash
gitvan ai chat
> I want to automatically track my daily development progress
> Include commits, PR activity, issues worked on
> Generate weekly summaries for team standup
> Track velocity and productivity metrics

AI: I'll create a development tracking system:

**Daily Diary Job** (runs at end of day):
- Collects commits with meaningful messages
- Tracks PR reviews and merges
- Notes issues opened/closed
- Generates readable daily summary

**Weekly Summary Job** (runs Sunday night):
- Aggregates week's activities
- Calculates productivity metrics
- Identifies blockers and achievements
- Formats for team sharing

> Add mood tracking based on commit message sentiment
```

### CI/CD Integration Workflows

#### Deployment Pipeline Automation
```bash
gitvan ai chat --template deployment
> Create a complete CI/CD pipeline that:
> - Runs tests on every push
> - Builds Docker images for releases
> - Deploys to staging automatically
> - Requires approval for production
> - Rolls back on deployment failures
> - Sends notifications at each stage

AI: I'll design a comprehensive deployment pipeline with safety checks...

**Pipeline Structure:**
1. **Test Job** - Continuous testing
2. **Build Job** - Image creation and tagging
3. **Staging Deploy** - Automated staging deployment
4. **Production Gate** - Manual approval system
5. **Production Deploy** - Controlled production release
6. **Health Check** - Post-deployment validation
7. **Rollback Job** - Emergency rollback capability

> Also add performance monitoring and alerting
```

### Documentation Workflows

#### API Documentation Automation
```bash
gitvan ai chat --mode docs
> Generate API documentation from code comments
> Include OpenAPI spec generation
> Create usage examples for each endpoint
> Update docs on every API change
> Generate client SDK documentation

AI: Creating API documentation automation:

**API Doc Generator Job:**
- Scans code for API routes and comments
- Generates OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- Creates markdown documentation
- Includes request/response examples

**SDK Doc Job:**
- Generates client library docs
- Creates usage examples
- Updates integration guides

> Add automated testing of documentation examples
```

#### Knowledge Base Maintenance
```bash
gitvan ai chat
> Maintain our team knowledge base:
> - Extract insights from resolved issues
> - Generate troubleshooting guides
> - Create onboarding documentation
> - Update architecture diagrams
> - Sync with external wikis

AI: I'll create a knowledge management system:

**Knowledge Extractor Job:**
- Analyzes closed issues for patterns
- Extracts solutions and workarounds
- Generates searchable knowledge articles

**Documentation Sync Job:**
- Updates team wiki
- Maintains architecture diagrams
- Syncs with external documentation

> Include automated knowledge validation and updates
```

## 🎨 Advanced Chat Features

### Context-Aware Conversations

#### Repository Intelligence
```bash
gitvan ai chat --analyze-repo
AI: I've analyzed your repository. I see:
- Node.js project with TypeScript
- Uses Jest for testing
- Has GitHub Actions workflows
- Dependencies include Express, React
- Recent focus on API development

How can I help you automate your workflows?

> Create jobs specific to our stack
```

#### Project Pattern Recognition
```bash
gitvan ai chat --learn-patterns
AI: I've learned from your Git history:
- You typically release every 2 weeks
- Hotfixes go directly to main branch
- Features use feature/ branch naming
- You follow conventional commits mostly

I can suggest workflows that match your patterns.

> Suggest improvements to our current process
```

### Multi-Turn Refinement

#### Incremental Improvement
```bash
# Turn 1: Basic requirement
> Create a backup job

# Turn 2: Add specificity
> Make it backup to multiple cloud providers

# Turn 3: Add intelligence
> Only backup changed files to save bandwidth

# Turn 4: Add monitoring
> Send alerts if backup fails or takes too long

# Turn 5: Add automation
> Schedule based on development activity level
```

#### Error Handling and Recovery
```bash
> The job you created has an error in the Git commands

AI: I see the issue. The git command syntax was incorrect. Let me fix that:

[Shows corrected version with explanation]

> Now add retry logic for network failures

AI: Adding exponential backoff retry mechanism...

> Perfect! Test this job in dry-run mode first
```

### Collaborative Workflows

#### Team-Based Job Creation
```bash
gitvan ai chat --team-context
> Our team needs a workflow for code reviews
> Frontend devs want automated UI testing
> Backend devs need API validation
> DevOps wants deployment automation
> QA needs test result aggregation

AI: I'll create role-specific jobs that work together:

**Frontend Review Job:**
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility checks
- Performance analysis

**Backend Review Job:**
- API contract validation
- Security scanning
- Database migration checks

**Integration Job:**
- Coordinates all checks
- Provides unified status
- Manages deployment gates

> Add job assignment based on file patterns
```

## 🔍 Debugging and Optimization

### Chat-Based Debugging
```bash
gitvan ai chat --debug-mode
> My release job is failing with Git errors

AI: Let me help debug this. Can you share:
1. The exact error message
2. Your current Git state
3. The job configuration

> Error: "fatal: tag 'v1.2.3' already exists"

AI: The issue is tag collision. I'll modify your job to:
- Check for existing tags first
- Use incremental versioning
- Add tag cleanup options

Here's the fixed version...
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
gitvan ai chat --optimize
> My changelog job takes 5 minutes to run

AI: That's slow for changelog generation. Let me analyze:
- Are you processing the entire Git history?
- How many commits are you analyzing?
- What's the bottleneck?

> It processes all commits since repository creation

AI: Found the issue! I'll optimize it to:
- Only process commits since last release
- Cache common queries
- Use Git's built-in performance features
- Add progress indicators

Expected time reduction: ~90%
```

## 📚 Chat Best Practices

### Effective Prompt Patterns

#### Be Specific About Requirements
```bash
❌ "Create a deployment job"
✅ "Create a deployment job that builds Docker images, runs tests, deploys to staging on feature branches, and requires manual approval for production deployment"
```

#### Provide Context and Constraints
```bash
❌ "Make a backup system"
✅ "Create a backup system for our Node.js API that runs nightly, stores in S3, retains 30 days of backups, and alerts on failures. We have 500MB of code and 2GB of data."
```

#### Use Iterative Refinement
```bash
✅ Start simple: "Create a changelog job"
✅ Add features: "Include contributor info"
✅ Enhance quality: "Add breaking change detection"
✅ Improve UX: "Format as GitHub markdown"
```

### Conversation Management

#### Save Important Conversations
```bash
# Save conversation for reuse
gitvan ai chat --save-session release-automation

# Resume saved conversation
gitvan ai chat --load-session release-automation

# Share conversation with team
gitvan ai chat --export-session team-workflows.json
```

#### Organize by Workflow Type
```bash
# Separate chats for different domains
gitvan ai chat --session ci-cd
gitvan ai chat --session documentation
gitvan ai chat --session security
gitvan ai chat --session release-management
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Always Review Generated Code
```bash
> Show me the complete job code before saving

AI: [Displays full job implementation]

> Explain the error handling logic

AI: [Explains each error case and recovery mechanism]

> Test this with our sample repository
```

#### Use Dry-Run Testing
```bash
> Create this job in test mode first

AI: I'll add a `--dry-run` flag so you can verify the behavior safely:

```javascript
if (options.dryRun) {
  console.log('Would execute:', command);
  return;
}
```

> Perfect! Run a test with sample data
```
