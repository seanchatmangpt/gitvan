## 📝 Example JTBD Scenarios

### JTBD Management
```gherkin
Scenario: List all available JTBD hooks
  Given I have a GitVan project
  And I have JTBD hooks configured
  When I run the GitVan command "jtbd list"
  Then the command should succeed
  And I should see "Available JTBD Hooks" in the output
```

### JTBD Execution
```gherkin
Scenario: Execute code quality gatekeeper on pre-commit
  Given I have a JTBD hook named "code-quality-gatekeeper"
  And the hook is configured for "pre-commit" events
  When I commit changes to the repository
  Then the code quality gatekeeper should execute
  And the commit should be allowed if quality standards are met
```

### JTBD Knowledge Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: JTBD hook with SPARQL predicate evaluation
  Given I have a JTBD hook named "intelligent-code-review"
  And the hook uses SPARQL predicates for evaluation
  When the hook executes
  Then it should evaluate SPARQL queries against the knowledge graph
  And the hook should make intelligent decisions based on the results
```

## 🚀 Available Commands

```bash
# Run all BDD tests
pnpm test:bdd

# Run BDD tests in watch mode
pnpm test:bdd:watch

# Run with custom BDD runner
pnpm test:bdd:runner

# Run JTBD demonstration
node demo-jtbd-london-bdd.mjs
```
