# DMEDI Phase 5: Implement

## Overview of the Implement Phase

Welcome to the final phase of the DMEDI methodology: **Implement**. After defining our goals, measuring customer needs, exploring concepts, and developing a detailed design, it is now time to bring our design to life. The goal of the Implement phase is to execute the design, verify that it meets the requirements, and ensure that the new product or process is successfully integrated into the business.

This phase is not just about "launching"; it's about a controlled rollout that includes testing, monitoring, and planning for long-term success.

### Key Objectives of the Implement Phase:

1.  **Build and Test the Design:** Construct the final product or process based on the detailed design from the Develop phase.
2.  **Run a Pilot/Beta Program:** Test the design in a real-world environment with a limited set of users to gather feedback and identify any remaining issues before a full-scale launch.
3.  **Develop a Control Plan:** Implement a plan to monitor the performance of the new product or process over time to ensure it continues to meet specifications.
4.  **Finalize the Implementation Plan:** Create a detailed plan for the full-scale launch, including marketing, training, and support.
5.  **Handover and Closure:** Formally close the project and hand over the new product or process to the long-term owners.

### GitVan v3.0 Case Study Application

For the GitVan v3.0 project, the Implement phase is the culmination of all our design work. It involves writing the code, running a beta program with real developers, and preparing for the public launch.

We will use the following tools and deliverables to complete the Implement phase:

*   **Prototype and Pilot:** We will discuss how software prototyping, alpha testing, and beta programs are used to validate the design of GitVan v3 with real users before the official launch.
*   **Process Control Plan:** We will create a control plan for monitoring the key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) that we defined for our key system components (like the Knowledge Hook Engine), using control charts to ensure they remain stable and capable in production.
*   **Implementation Planning:** We will use the high-level timeline from the v3.0 Release Plan to create a more detailed launch plan.
*   **DMEDI Capstone:** We will conclude the course with a capstone project, where you will apply the entire DMEDI framework to a new challenge for the GitVan product line.

By the end of this phase, we will have successfully launched GitVan v3.0 and put in place the systems needed to monitor and control its performance over the long term, ensuring that the value we designed into the product is actually delivered to our customers.
