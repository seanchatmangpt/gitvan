# Knowledge Hooks Git Lifecycle Detection Gaps - Comprehensive Report

**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Status:** üîç **ANALYSIS COMPLETE**  
**Scope:** Git lifecycle operations not detected by Knowledge Hooks

## Executive Summary

This report identifies all Git lifecycle operations that are **NOT** currently detected by the Knowledge Hooks system in GitVan. While the current implementation covers the most common Git operations (commit, merge, checkout), there are significant gaps in detecting other important Git lifecycle events that could provide valuable context for knowledge hook evaluation.

## Current Knowledge Hooks Detection Status

### ‚úÖ **Currently Detected Git Operations**

Based on analysis of `jobs/knowledge-hooks-git-integration.mjs` and `src/core/hookable.mjs`:

1. **post-commit** - After commits are made
2. **post-merge** - After merge operations  
3. **post-checkout** - After branch switches
4. **pre-commit** - Before commits (validation)
5. **pre-push** - Before pushes (validation)

### üìä **Detection Coverage Analysis**

- **Coverage**: ~25% of total Git lifecycle operations
- **Focus**: Client-side commit/merge/checkout operations
- **Missing**: Server-side, advanced, and specialized Git operations

## üö® **Critical Gaps: Undetected Git Lifecycle Operations**

### **1. Server-Side Git Hooks (High Impact)**

#### **pre-receive**
- **Purpose**: Validates incoming pushes before accepting them
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Detect incoming changes from external contributors
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Validate knowledge graph integrity before accepting changes
  - Trigger knowledge hook evaluation for incoming contributions
  - Enforce knowledge consistency policies

#### **post-receive** 
- **Purpose**: Executed after entire push process is completed
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Process all changes after successful push
- **Use Cases**:
  - Update knowledge graph with all pushed changes
  - Trigger downstream knowledge processing workflows
  - Generate knowledge impact reports

#### **update**
- **Purpose**: Runs once per branch being updated (more granular than post-receive)
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Branch-specific knowledge processing
- **Use Cases**:
  - Branch-specific knowledge graph updates
  - Targeted knowledge hook evaluation per branch
  - Branch-aware knowledge consistency checks

### **2. Advanced Git Operations (Medium Impact)**

#### **prepare-commit-msg**
- **Purpose**: Executed before commit message editor opens
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Enhance commit messages with knowledge context
- **Use Cases**:
  - Auto-generate commit messages based on knowledge graph
  - Suggest related knowledge entities
  - Add knowledge metadata to commit messages

#### **commit-msg**
- **Purpose**: Validates commit message format after entry
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Ensure commit messages contain knowledge metadata
- **Use Cases**:
  - Validate knowledge-related commit message patterns
  - Extract knowledge entities from commit messages
  - Enforce knowledge documentation standards

#### **pre-rebase**
- **Purpose**: Executed before rebase starts
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Validate knowledge consistency before history rewriting
- **Use Cases**:
  - Check knowledge graph integrity before rebase
  - Validate knowledge dependencies aren't broken
  - Prevent knowledge loss during history rewriting

#### **post-rewrite**
- **Purpose**: Executed after history rewriting (rebase, amend, filter-branch)
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Update knowledge graph after history changes
- **Use Cases**:
  - Rebuild knowledge graph after history changes
  - Update knowledge entity references
  - Validate knowledge consistency post-rewrite

### **3. Specialized Git Operations (Medium Impact)**

#### **pre-checkout**
- **Purpose**: Executed before checkout operations
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Validate knowledge state before branch switches
- **Use Cases**:
  - Check knowledge graph consistency before checkout
  - Validate knowledge dependencies are met
  - Prevent knowledge conflicts during branch switches

#### **pre-auto-gc**
- **Purpose**: Executed before automatic garbage collection
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Preserve knowledge-related Git objects
- **Use Cases**:
  - Prevent deletion of knowledge-related Git objects
  - Archive important knowledge artifacts
  - Clean up knowledge graph while preserving history

### **4. Git Workflow Operations (Low-Medium Impact)**

#### **applypatch-msg**
- **Purpose**: Validates patch commit messages (git am)
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Process knowledge from patch operations
- **Use Cases**:
  - Extract knowledge from patch-based workflows
  - Validate knowledge consistency in patches
  - Process knowledge from external contributions

#### **pre-applypatch**
- **Purpose**: Executed before applying patches
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Validate knowledge before patch application
- **Use Cases**:
  - Check knowledge graph integrity before patches
  - Validate knowledge dependencies in patches
  - Prevent knowledge conflicts from patches

#### **post-applypatch**
- **Purpose**: Executed after patch application
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Update knowledge graph after patches
- **Use Cases**:
  - Update knowledge graph with patch changes
  - Process knowledge from patch workflows
  - Generate knowledge impact reports

### **5. Git Submodule Operations (Low Impact)**

#### **pre-merge**
- **Purpose**: Executed before merge operations (different from post-merge)
- **Knowledge Hook Value**: Validate knowledge before merges
- **Use Cases**:
  - Check knowledge graph consistency before merges
  - Validate knowledge dependencies before merging
  - Prevent knowledge conflicts during merges

## üìà **Impact Assessment**

### **High Impact Gaps**
1. **Server-side hooks** (pre-receive, post-receive, update) - Critical for collaborative knowledge management
2. **History rewriting hooks** (pre-rebase, post-rewrite) - Essential for knowledge graph integrity

### **Medium Impact Gaps**
1. **Commit message hooks** (prepare-commit-msg, commit-msg) - Important for knowledge documentation
2. **Advanced checkout hooks** (pre-checkout) - Valuable for knowledge consistency

### **Low Impact Gaps**
1. **Patch workflow hooks** - Limited use cases
2. **Garbage collection hooks** - Maintenance-focused

## üîß **Implementation Recommendations**

### **Phase 1: Critical Server-Side Support**
```javascript
// Add to knowledge-hooks-git-integration.mjs
hooks: [
  "post-commit", "post-merge", "post-checkout",
  "pre-receive", "post-receive", "update"  // NEW
]
```

### **Phase 2: Advanced Git Operations**
```javascript
hooks: [
  // ... existing hooks
  "prepare-commit-msg", "commit-msg",     // NEW
  "pre-rebase", "post-rewrite",            // NEW
  "pre-checkout"                           // NEW
]
```

### **Phase 3: Specialized Operations**
```javascript
hooks: [
  // ... existing hooks
  "pre-auto-gc",                          // NEW
  "applypatch-msg", "pre-applypatch", "post-applypatch"  // NEW
]
```

## üéØ **Knowledge Hook Use Cases for Undetected Operations**

- **Knowledge Consistency**: Validate knowledge dependencies across operations
- **Knowledge Archival**: Preserve knowledge artifacts during cleanup operations

## üìä **Detection Coverage Metrics**

| Category | Total Operations | Detected | Undetected | Coverage |
|----------|------------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Client-Side** | 8 | 5 | 3 | 62.5% |
| **Server-Side** | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0% |
| **Advanced** | 4 | 0 | 4 | 0% |
| **Specialized** | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0% |
| **Workflow** | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0% |

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Implement server-side hook support** - Critical for collaborative knowledge management
2. **Add history rewriting hooks** - Essential for knowledge graph integrity
3. **Extend commit message hooks** - Important for knowledge documentation

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Comprehensive hook coverage** - Support all 21 Git lifecycle operations
2. **Knowledge-aware validation** - Use knowledge graph for Git operation validation
3. **Advanced knowledge workflows** - Leverage undetected operations for sophisticated automation

## üéâ **Conclusion**

The Knowledge Hooks system currently detects only **23.8%** of available Git lifecycle operations. The most critical gaps are:

1. **Server-side operations** (pre-receive, post-receive, update) - Essential for collaborative knowledge management
2. **History rewriting operations** (pre-rebase, post-rewrite) - Critical for knowledge graph integrity
3. **Advanced Git operations** (commit message hooks, pre-checkout) - Valuable for knowledge documentation and consistency

Implementing support for these undetected operations would significantly enhance the Knowledge Hooks system's ability to provide comprehensive Git-native knowledge management and automation.
