# C4 Architecture for Turtle as Workflow

This document outlines the software architecture for the "Turtle as Workflow" engine within GitVan using the C4 model. The diagrams illustrate how a user interacts with the system, how the system is composed of containers, and how those containers are built from specific, interoperable components.

## Level 1: System Context Diagram

This diagram shows the workflow engine as a single "black box" and illustrates how it interacts with users and other systems in its environment. It provides a high-level overview of the system's scope and its key relationships.

```mermaid
C4Context
  title System Context Diagram for GitVan Workflow Engine

  Person(developer, "Developer", "Defines workflows in Turtle (.ttl) files and triggers runs via the CLI.")

  System(workflowEngine, "GitVan Workflow Engine", "Executes declarative, graph-based workflows triggered by commits or CLI commands.")

  SystemDb_Ext(repo, "Git Repository", "Stores workflow definitions (.ttl), source data, and execution receipts (Git Notes).")
  SystemDb_Ext(fs, "File System", "The local workspace where the engine reads source files and writes artifacts (e.g., reports, generated code).")
  System_Ext(externalApis, "External APIs", "Third-party services (e.g., GitHub, JIRA, Slack) that workflow steps can interact with via HTTP.")

  Rel(developer, workflowEngine, "Triggers workflow runs")
  Rel(developer, repo, "Defines workflows in .ttl files")

  Rel(workflowEngine, repo, "Reads workflow definitions, Writes receipts")
  Rel(workflowEngine, fs, "Reads/Writes files and artifacts")
  Rel(workflowEngine, externalApis, "Makes API calls")

  UpdateRelStyle(developer, workflowEngine, $textColor="white", $bgColor="blue", $borderColor="blue")
```

### Key Interactions:

- **The Developer** is the primary user who defines the logic of the workflow in .ttl files and initiates a run.
- **The Workflow Engine** reads its instructions from the Git Repository, performs actions on the local File System, and can communicate with any External APIs.
- **All results and auditable logs** (receipts) are written back to the Git Repository.

## Level 2: Container Diagram

This diagram zooms into the "GitVan Workflow Engine" to show its major internal building blocks, or "containers." Each container represents a separate application or a major, deployable component.

```mermaid
C4Container
  title Container Diagram for GitVan Workflow Engine

  Person(developer, "Developer")

  System_Boundary(c1, "GitVan Workflow System") {
    Container(cli, "GitVan CLI", "Node.js Application", "The primary user entry point. Parses commands and delegates to the Workflow Executor.")
    Container(executor, "Workflow Executor", "Node.js Library", "The core engine that parses, plans, and runs the workflow graph. This is where the main logic resides.")
    ContainerDb(definitions, "Workflow Definitions", "Turtle (.ttl) Files", "The declarative graph files that define the steps, dependencies, and logic of all workflows.")
    ContainerDb(context, "Execution Context", "In-Memory State", "Maintains the state of the current workflow execution, including step inputs/outputs and intermediate results.")
  }

  System_Ext(externalApis, "External APIs")
  SystemDb_Ext(repo, "Git Repository")
  SystemDb_Ext(fs, "File System")

  Rel(developer, cli, "Executes 'gitvan workflow run'")
  Rel(cli, executor, "Invokes a specific workflow by its ID")
  Rel(executor, definitions, "Parses the workflow .ttl file")
  Rel(executor, context, "Manages execution state")
  Rel(executor, repo, "Writes execution receipts")
  Rel(executor, fs, "Reads/Writes files and artifacts")
  Rel(executor, externalApis, "Executes HTTP steps")

  UpdateRelStyle(developer, cli, $textColor="white", $bgColor="blue", $borderColor="blue")
```

### Key Containers:

- **The GitVan CLI** is the user-facing application.
- **The Workflow Executor** is the backend library that contains the core logic. It is headless and can be controlled by the CLI or other triggers.
- **The Workflow Definitions** are the .ttl files themselves, treated as a data container that the Executor reads from.
- **The Execution Context** maintains the state of the current workflow execution.

## Level 3: Component Diagram

This diagram zooms into the Workflow Executor container to show its internal components. These components map directly to the JavaScript modules we have designed, with special emphasis on the RDF Composable Architecture.

```mermaid
C4Component
  title Component Diagram for the Workflow Executor

  Container_Boundary(c1, "Workflow Executor") {
    Component(executor, "WorkflowExecutor.mjs", "Orchestrator", "The main entry point. Coordinates parsing, planning, and execution.")
    
    Component(parser, "WorkflowParser.mjs", "Parser & Validator", "Loads a specific workflow .ttl file, validates its structure, and parses it into an in-memory object model.")
    Component(planner, "DAGPlanner.mjs", "Execution Planner", "Performs a topological sort on the parsed steps to create a linear, valid execution order.")
    Component(runner, "StepRunner.mjs", "Step Execution Engine", "Executes a single step from the plan by invoking the appropriate composable or library.")
    Component(context, "ContextManager.mjs", "State Manager", "Holds the in-memory state of the current workflow run, including inputs and outputs of all steps.")

    Component_Boundary(rdf, "RDF Composable Architecture") {
      Component(turtle, "turtle.mjs", "Data Ingestion", "Handles loading, parsing, and querying of Turtle (.ttl) files with context-aware configuration.")
      Component(graph, "graph.mjs", "Operational Interface", "Provides high-level, ergonomic API for graph operations including SPARQL queries and SHACL validation.")
      Component(engine, "RdfEngine.mjs", "Core Processing Engine", "Production-grade RDF engine with comprehensive capabilities including reasoning, canonicalization, and set operations.")
    }
  }

  SystemDb_Ext(definitions, "Workflow Definitions (.ttl)")
  SystemDb_Ext(fs, "File System")
  System_Ext(externalApis, "External APIs")

  Rel(executor, parser, "Uses to load and validate")
  Rel(executor, planner, "Uses to create a plan from parsed steps")
  Rel(executor, runner, "Invokes for each step in the plan")
  
  Rel(parser, definitions, "Reads and parses")
  Rel(parser, turtle, "Uses for Turtle file processing")
  
  Rel(runner, context, "Reads step inputs from and writes outputs to")
  Rel(runner, graph, "Uses for graph operations")
  Rel(runner, engine, "Uses for advanced RDF processing")
  Rel(runner, fs, "Reads/Writes files")
  Rel(runner, externalApis, "Makes API calls")

  Rel(turtle, graph, "Provides N3 Store")
  Rel(graph, engine, "Uses for SPARQL and validation")
  Rel(turtle, engine, "Uses for parsing and serialization")

  UpdateRelStyle(executor, parser, $textColor="white", $bgColor="blue", $borderColor="blue")
  UpdateRelStyle(executor, planner, $textColor="white", $bgColor="blue", $borderColor="blue")
  UpdateRelStyle(executor, runner, $textColor="white", $bgColor="blue", $borderColor="blue")
```

### Key Components & Data Flow:

1. **The WorkflowExecutor** is initiated.
2. **It calls the WorkflowParser** to load and validate the target .ttl file.
3. **The parsed, validated steps** are passed to the DAGPlanner, which creates a safe execution order.
4. **The WorkflowExecutor** iterates through this plan, passing each step to the StepRunner.
5. **The StepRunner** communicates with the ContextManager to get its inputs and write its outputs.
6. **To perform its actual work**, the StepRunner uses the RDF Composable Architecture components.

## Level 4: Code Diagram

This diagram shows the detailed implementation of the RDF Composable Architecture components and their relationships.

## Workflow Execution Flow

### 1. **Initialization Phase**

```javascript

```

### 2. **Parsing Phase**

```javascript
// WorkflowParser.mjs
const workflow = await turtle.getHooks();
const steps = workflow.map(hook => 
  turtle.getPipelineSteps(hook.pipelines[0])

```

### 3. **Planning Phase**

```javascript
// DAGPlanner.mjs
const executionPlan = await workflowGraph.query(`
  SELECT ?step ?dependsOn WHERE {
    ?step a ex:WorkflowStep .
    ?step ex:dependsOn ?dependsOn .
  } ORDER BY ?step
`);
```

### 4. **Execution Phase**

```javascript
// StepRunner.mjs
for (const step of executionPlan) {
  const result = await workflowGraph.query(step.sparqlQuery);
  await context.setStepOutput(step.id, result);
}
```

### 5. **Validation Phase**

```javascript
// Post-execution validation
const validation = await workflowGraph.validate(shaclShapes);
if (!validation.conforms) {
  throw new Error(`Workflow validation failed: ${validation.results}`);
}
```
