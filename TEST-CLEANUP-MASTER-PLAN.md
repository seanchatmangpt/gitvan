# GitVan Test Suite Cleanup - Master Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to clean up and consolidate the GitVan test suite, reducing it from 200+ files to ~80-100 focused, production-critical tests.

## Document Structure
1. **Phase 1: Immediate Cleanup** - Remove obvious waste
2. **Phase 2: Consolidation** - Merge duplicates and refactor
3. **Phase 3: Optimization** - Improve remaining tests
4. **Phase 4: Standardization** - Create consistent patterns

## Success Metrics
- **Reduce test files by 60%** (200+ â†’ 80-100)
- **Eliminate all duplicates** (0% duplication)
- **Remove all demo/skipped tests** (<5% non-production)
- **Maintain comprehensive coverage** of core functionality
- **Improve test execution speed** by 50%

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Phase 1 - Immediate Cleanup
- **Week 2:** Phase 2 - Consolidation  
- **Week 3:** Phase 3 - Optimization
- **Week 4:** Phase 4 - Standardization

## Risk Mitigation
- **Backup before deletion** - Git history preserves all changes
- **Test after each phase** - Ensure functionality still works
- **Incremental approach** - Small, safe changes
- **Documentation** - Track all changes made

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass after each phase
- No reduction in actual test coverage
- Improved test execution time
- Clearer test organization
