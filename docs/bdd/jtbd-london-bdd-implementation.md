# GitVan JTBD London BDD Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of London BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style testing specifically for GitVan's JTBD (Jobs To Be Done) functionality. This approach focuses on **user job-to-be-done scenarios** and how GitVan helps accomplish them through intelligent automation.

## JTBD London BDD Principles

### 1. User-Centric Focus
- Start with what users are trying to accomplish
- Understand the job the user is hiring GitVan to do
- Focus on user outcomes, not technical implementation

### 2. Job-Focused Scenarios
- Write scenarios from the user's perspective
- Use domain language that users understand
- Focus on the job-to-be-done, not the tool

### 3. Context-Aware Testing
- Consider the situation and context of the job
- Test how GitVan adapts to different contexts
- Verify intelligent decision making

### 4. Outcome-Oriented Verification
- Focus on desired outcomes, not processes
- Verify that user jobs are accomplished
- Test the value delivered to users

## Feature Files

### JTBD Management Feature
Tests the CLI management of JTBD hooks:

```gherkin
Feature: GitVan JTBD (Jobs To Be Done) Management
  As a developer
  I want to manage Jobs-to-be-Done hooks in GitVan
  So that I can automate development workflows based on user needs

  Scenario: List all available JTBD hooks
    Given I have a GitVan project
    And I have JTBD hooks configured
    When I run the GitVan command "jtbd list"
    Then the command should succeed
    And I should see "Available JTBD Hooks" in the output
```

### JTBD Execution Feature
Tests event-driven execution of JTBD hooks:

```gherkin
Feature: GitVan JTBD Hook Execution
  As a developer
  I want JTBD hooks to execute automatically based on Git events
  So that development workflows are automated according to user needs

  Scenario: Execute code quality gatekeeper on pre-commit
    Given I have a JTBD hook named "code-quality-gatekeeper"
    And the hook is configured for "pre-commit" events
    When I commit changes to the repository
    Then the code quality gatekeeper should execute
    And the commit should be allowed if quality standards are met
```

### JTBD Knowledge Integration Feature
Tests integration with the Knowledge Hook Engine:

```gherkin
Feature: GitVan JTBD Knowledge Hook Integration
  As a developer
  I want JTBD hooks to integrate with the Knowledge Hook Engine
  So that intelligent automation can be achieved based on project context

  Scenario: JTBD hook with SPARQL predicate evaluation
    Given I have a JTBD hook named "intelligent-code-review"
    And the hook uses SPARQL predicates for evaluation
    When the hook executes
    Then it should evaluate SPARQL queries against the knowledge graph
    And the hook should make intelligent decisions based on the results
```

## Step Definitions

### Given Steps - Setting Up JTBD Context

```javascript
Given("I have JTBD hooks configured", async function () {
  // Create JTBD hooks directory with sample hooks
  await bddUtils.createTestFiles("gitvan-project", {
    "hooks/code-quality-gatekeeper.mjs": hookContent,
    "hooks/dependency-vulnerability-scanner.mjs": scannerContent,
    // ... more hooks
  });
  console.log("âœ… JTBD hooks configured");
});

Given("I have a JTBD hook named {string}", async function (hookName) {
  // Create a specific JTBD hook
  const hookContent = `export default defineJob({...})`;
  await bddUtils.createTestFiles("gitvan-project", {
    [`hooks/${hookName}.mjs`]: hookContent
  });
  console.log(`âœ… JTBD hook '${hookName}' created`);
});
```

### When Steps - Triggering JTBD Actions

```javascript
When("I commit changes to the repository", async function () {
  // Simulate Git commit event
  const repoPath = bddUtils.getTestData("repoPath");
  await execFileAsync("git", ["add", "."], { cwd: repoPath });
  await execFileAsync("git", ["commit", "-m", "Test commit"], { cwd: repoPath });
  console.log("ðŸ”„ Changes committed to repository");
});

When("I run the GitVan command {string}", async function (command) {
  // Execute GitVan CLI command
  const result = await bddUtils.executeGitVanCommand(command);
  bddUtils.setTestData("lastCommandResult", result);
  console.log(`ðŸ”„ Executed: gitvan ${command}`);
});
```

### Then Steps - Verifying JTBD Outcomes

```javascript
Then("the code quality gatekeeper should execute", async function () {
  // Verify hook execution
  console.log("âœ… Code quality gatekeeper executed");
});

Then("the commit should be allowed if quality standards are met", async function () {
  // Verify commit was allowed
  console.log("âœ… Commit allowed - quality standards met");
});

Then("it should evaluate SPARQL queries against the knowledge graph", async function () {
  // Verify SPARQL evaluation
  console.log("âœ… SPARQL queries evaluated against knowledge graph");
});
```
