# Implement: Implementation Planning

## From Strategy to Execution

In the Define phase, we created a high-level project plan. Now, in the Implement phase, we create a detailed **Implementation Plan** that covers the final stages of the project: the beta program, the public launch, and the post-launch transition.

This plan is a tactical, step-by-step guide for the entire team, including engineering, marketing, and support.
