## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for core components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration tests (2/3 passing)
- ‚úÖ Security tests for signature verification
- ‚úÖ Idempotency tests for rollback scenarios

### Recommended Test Improvements
- [ ] Add more edge case testing for template processing
- [ ] Add performance tests for large pack operations
- [ ] Add security penetration tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end user workflow tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Template Processing Issues**: Could affect pack installation reliability
- **Integration Test Failures**: Reduces confidence in system stability

### Medium Risk
- **Registry Integration**: Could limit pack discovery and management
- **Error Handling**: Could lead to poor user experience

### Low Risk
- **Advanced Features**: Nice-to-have but not critical for core functionality

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All integration tests passing (3/3)
- [ ] Template processing error rate < 1%
- [ ] Pack installation success rate > 99%
- [ ] Security vulnerability count = 0

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Pack installation time < 30 seconds
- [ ] Error message clarity score > 8/10
- [ ] User satisfaction score > 8/10

## Conclusion

The GitVan Pack System has a **solid foundation** with core functionality working well. The main focus should be on **fixing template processing edge cases** and **ensuring integration tests pass consistently**. Once these critical issues are resolved, the system will be ready for production use with a clear path for future enhancements.

**Next Priority**: Fix template processing null/undefined value handling and integration test failures.
