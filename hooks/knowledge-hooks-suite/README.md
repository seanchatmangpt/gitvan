## 🔧 Implementation

### **Master Integration Job**

The `knowledge-hooks-comprehensive-suite.mjs` job provides master integration:

```javascript
export default defineJob({
  meta: {
    name: "knowledge-hooks-comprehensive-suite",
    desc: "Comprehensive Knowledge Hooks Suite - Complete Git lifecycle coverage",
    tags: ["knowledge-hooks", "git-lifecycle", "comprehensive", "reporting"],
    version: "1.0.0",
  },

  hooks: [
    "pre-commit", "post-commit", "pre-push", "post-merge", "post-checkout",
    "pre-receive", "post-receive", "pre-rebase", "post-rewrite",
    "prepare-commit-msg", "commit-msg", "pre-checkout", "pre-auto-gc"
  ],

  async run(context) {
    // Comprehensive Git state capture
    // Knowledge hooks evaluation
    // Disk-based reporting
    // Repository health monitoring
  }
});
```

### **Individual Hook Implementations**

Each hook follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Git State Capture** - Comprehensive state analysis
2. **Knowledge Graph Impact Assessment** - Identify affected knowledge files
3. **Disk-Based Reporting** - Write detailed JSON reports
4. **Recommendations Generation** - Provide actionable insights

## 📈 Reporting System

### **Report Locations**
- **Git State Reports**: `reports/git-state/`
- **Knowledge Hooks Reports**: `reports/knowledge-hooks/`

### **Report Structure**

Each report includes:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T10:30:00Z",
  "hookType": "post-commit",
  "gitState": {
    "commitInfo": { "sha": "...", "message": "...", "author": "..." },
    "changedFiles": [...],
    "knowledgeFiles": [...],
    "hooksAffected": [...],
    "repositoryHealth": { "totalCommits": 1000, "totalBranches": 5 }
  },
  "analysis": {
    "filesCommitted": 5,
    "knowledgeFilesCommitted": 2,
    "hooksCommitted": 1,
    "commitSize": { "linesAdded": 100, "linesDeleted": 10 }
  },
  "knowledgeGraph": {
    "filesAffected": [...],
    "hooksAffected": [...],
    "impactAssessment": { "level": "medium", "description": "..." }
  },
  "recommendations": [...]
}
```

## 🎯 Knowledge Graph Integration

### **Impact Assessment Levels**

- **High Impact**: Hooks system changes detected
- **Medium Impact**: Knowledge graph changes detected  
- **Low Impact**: No knowledge graph changes

### **Affected Areas Tracking**

- **Knowledge Graph Files**: `.ttl`, `.rdf`, `graph/` directory
- **Hooks System Files**: `hooks/` directory, `.hook.` files
- **Repository Health**: Commit count, branch count, tag count

## 🚀 Usage

### **Installation**

1. Copy the suite files to your GitVan project
2. Ensure the `reports/` directory is writable
3. The hooks will automatically run on Git operations

### **Configuration**

The suite works with existing GitVan configuration:

```javascript
// gitvan.config.js
export default {
  hooks: {
    dirs: ["hooks"],
    autoEvaluate: true,
  },
  // ... other configuration
};
```

### **Manual Execution**

Run the comprehensive suite manually:

```bash
# Run specific hook
pnpm gitvan hooks run post-commit

# Run all hooks
pnpm gitvan hooks run all
```
