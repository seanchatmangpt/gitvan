# DMEDI Phase 4: Develop

## Overview of the Develop Phase

Having explored various concepts and selected the most promising one, we now enter the **Develop** phase. The goal of this phase is to translate the high-level concept selected in the Explore phase into a detailed, buildable, and optimized design. This is where we finalize the blueprints for our product and process before full-scale implementation.

In the Develop phase, we use powerful statistical tools like Design of Experiments (DOE) to optimize our design parameters and ensure it is robust and reliable. We also apply Lean principles to ensure the design is efficient and free from waste.

### Key Objectives of the Develop Phase:

1.  **Create a Detailed Design:** Develop the high-level concept into a full set of detailed specifications, architectures, and component designs.
2.  **Optimize the Design:** Use Design of Experiments (DOE) to systematically test different design parameters and find the optimal combination that maximizes performance and quality.
3.  **Ensure Robustness:** Design the product or process to be insensitive to variation in the real-world environment (Robust Design).
4.  **Apply Lean Principles:** Ensure the design is efficient, easy to build, and free from waste (Design for Manufacturability and Assembly).
5.  **Plan for Reliability:** Analyze and design for the long-term reliability and maintainability of the product.

### GitVan v3.0 Case Study Application

For the GitVan v3.0 project, the Develop phase is where we refine the architecture and features to ensure they perform optimally and meet the SLOs we defined. We have chosen our core concepts (e.g., the RDF/SPARQL engine), and now we need to fine-tune the parameters of that design.

We will use the following tools and deliverables to complete the Develop phase:

*   **Detailed Design:** We will flesh out the high-level architecture into detailed component designs and API specifications.
*   **Design of Experiments (DOE):** We will use Full Factorial and Fractional Factorial experiments to optimize the performance of key system components. For example, we will design an experiment to find the optimal settings for our AI prompt generation to maximize the quality of the output.
*   **Simulations:** We will adapt classic DOE simulations like the "Catapult" and "Helicopter" to a software context, using them to optimize CLI performance and find the most robust configuration for our Knowledge Hook engine.
*   **Lean Design (DFMA):** We will discuss how Lean principles and Design for Manufacturability/Assembly apply to software, focusing on creating a system that is easy to test, deploy, and maintain.
*   **Reliability Engineering:** We will introduce the basic concepts of software reliability and how to design for fault tolerance.
*   **Advanced DOE & Analysis:** We will explore advanced techniques like Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for process optimization and Conjoint Analysis to understand which combination of features provides the most value to users.

By the end of this phase, we will have a complete, optimized, and validated design for GitVan v3.0. We will have confidence that our design is not only functional but also efficient, robust, and ready for the final **Implement** phase.
