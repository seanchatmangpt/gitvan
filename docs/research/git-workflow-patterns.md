# Git Workflow Patterns Research

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of Git workflow patterns that GitVan v2 could support beyond the traditional GitFlow model. Each pattern is evaluated for its suitability, complexity, and potential implementation in GitVan's automation platform.

## Executive Summary

GitVan currently supports GitFlow, but there are numerous other Git workflow patterns that could provide value to different types of teams and projects. This research identifies 12 distinct patterns, categorizes them by complexity and use case, and provides implementation recommendations for GitVan.

## Workflow Pattern Categories

### 1. Simple Workflows (Low Complexity)

#### 1.1 Centralized Workflow
**Description**: All developers work directly on the main branch, similar to traditional version control systems.

**Characteristics**:
- Single branch (main/master)
- Direct commits to main branch
- No branching strategy
- Minimal merge conflicts management

**Pros**:
- Extremely simple to understand and implement
- No branching overhead
- Suitable for small teams
- Quick setup and maintenance

**Cons**:
- High risk of conflicts with multiple developers
- No isolation of features
- Difficult to maintain code quality
- No rollback capabilities for features

**GitVan Implementation**:
```javascript
// Centralized Workflow Support
const centralizedWorkflow = {
  branches: ['main'],
  events: ['push-to/main', 'merge-to/main'],
  jobs: ['validate-commit', 'run-tests', 'deploy'],
  restrictions: {
    requirePullRequest: false,
    allowDirectPush: true
  }
};
```

**Use Cases**:
- Small teams (1-3 developers)
- Prototype projects
- Documentation repositories
- Simple scripts and utilities

---

#### 1.2 GitHub Flow
**Description**: Lightweight branching model with feature branches merged directly to main.

**Characteristics**:
- Main branch always deployable
- Feature branches for new work
- Direct merge to main after review
- Continuous deployment

**Pros**:
- Simple and efficient
- Supports continuous integration/deployment
- Clear workflow for small teams
- Fast iteration cycles

**Cons**:
- No support for multiple production versions
- Limited release management
- May not suit complex projects

**GitVan Implementation**:
```javascript
// GitHub Flow Support
const githubFlow = {
  branches: ['main'],
  featureBranches: true,
  events: [
    'push-to/main',
    'pull-request/opened',
    'pull-request/merged'
  ],
  jobs: [
    'validate-pr',
    'run-tests',
    'deploy-staging',
    'deploy-production'
  ],
  automation: {
    autoMerge: false,

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Workflows (Immediate)
1. **GitHub Flow** - Simple, widely adopted
2. **Centralized Workflow** - Minimal complexity
3. **GitLab Flow** - Environment-based

### Phase 2: Advanced Workflows (3-6 months)
1. **Trunk-Based Development** - High-performance teams
2. **Release Branching** - Versioned releases
3. **Hotfix Workflow** - Emergency response

### Phase 3: Specialized Workflows (6-12 months)
1. **Forking Workflow** - Open source support
2. **OneFlow** - GitFlow alternative
3. **Feature Toggle Workflow** - Modern deployment

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### 1. Workflow Configuration System
```javascript
// GitVan Workflow Configuration
const workflowConfig = {
  name: 'github-flow',
  version: '1.0.0',
  branches: {
    main: { protected: true, autoMerge: false },
    feature: { pattern: 'feature/*', autoDelete: true }
  },
  events: ['push-to/main', 'pull-request/opened'],
  jobs: ['validate-pr', 'run-tests', 'deploy'],
  automation: {
    requireReviews: true,
    requireStatusChecks: true,
    autoDeploy: true
  }
};
```

### 2. Workflow Detection
```javascript
// Automatic Workflow Detection
const detectWorkflow = async (repo) => {
  const branches = await git.listBranches();
  const patterns = analyzeBranchPatterns(branches);
  
  if (patterns.hasMainOnly) return 'centralized';
  if (patterns.hasFeatureBranches) return 'github-flow';
  if (patterns.hasEnvironmentBranches) return 'gitlab-flow';
  if (patterns.hasReleaseBranches) return 'gitflow';
  
  return 'unknown';
};
```

### 3. Workflow Migration
```javascript
// Workflow Migration Support
const migrateWorkflow = async (from, to) => {
  const migrationPlan = generateMigrationPlan(from, to);
  
  await executeMigrationSteps(migrationPlan);
  await validateMigration();
  await notifyTeam();
};
```

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Workflow Health Metrics
- Branch age distribution
- Merge frequency
- Conflict resolution time
- Deployment frequency
- Rollback frequency

### Performance Indicators
- Time to production
- Feature delivery time
- Bug resolution time
- Team productivity metrics

## Conclusion

GitVan should support multiple workflow patterns to accommodate different team sizes, project complexities, and organizational needs. The recommended implementation approach prioritizes simple, widely-adopted workflows first, then gradually adds more complex patterns based on user demand and feedback.

The key to success will be providing:
1. **Easy workflow selection** - Clear guidance on which workflow to choose
2. **Seamless migration** - Tools to move between workflows
3. **Workflow-specific automation** - Tailored jobs and events for each pattern
4. **Health monitoring** - Metrics to ensure workflow effectiveness
5. **Best practices** - Documentation and examples for each workflow

This multi-workflow support will position GitVan as a comprehensive Git automation platform that can adapt to any team's needs and evolve with their maturity level.
