# Implement: Process Control

## What is a Process Control Plan?

After a new product or process is launched, our work is not done. We need to ensure that it continues to perform as designed over the long term. A **Process Control Plan** is a document that outlines how we will monitor and control the process to maintain its performance and stability.

The goal is to move from *detecting* problems to *preventing* them. The control plan is the key to long-term success and continuous improvement.

### Key Components of a Control Plan:

*   **Control Subject:** What key metric will we monitor?
*   **Specification:** What are the target and limits for this metric?
*   **Measurement System:** How will we measure it?
*   **Sample Size & Frequency:** How often will we measure it?
*   **Control Method:** What tool will we use to monitor it (e.g., a control chart)?
*   **Reaction Plan:** What will we do if the process goes out of control?

## GitVan v3.0 Case Study: The SLO Control Plan

For the GitVan v3.0 project, the control plan will focus on monitoring the key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) that we defined for our key system components in the Develop phase. This ensures that the reliability and performance we designed into the system are maintained in production.

### Control Plan for the `AI-Workflow-Generator` Component

**Process Owner:** SRE Team Lead

| Control Subject (KPI) | Specification (SLO) | Measurement System | Sample Size & Frequency | Control Method | Reaction Plan (If Out of Control) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Availability** | 99.9% success rate over a 28-day rolling window. | Prometheus counter metric (`api_requests_total` with a `status` label). | **All** requests are measured continuously. The success rate is calculated every 5 minutes. | **Alerting Rule:** An alert is fired to the on-call engineer if the 1-hour error rate exceeds the error budget burn rate. | **1. Investigate:** Check the service logs and the status of the external AI provider. <br> **2. Escalate:** If the external provider is down, update the public status page. <br> **3. Mitigate:** If it's an internal bug, initiate the hotfix process. |
| **2. p99 Latency** | 99% of requests < 3000ms over a 1-hour rolling window. | Prometheus histogram metric (`api_request_latency_seconds`). | **All** requests are measured continuously. The p99 is calculated every 5 minutes. | **Control Chart (X-bar & R Chart):** The p99 latency is plotted on a control chart every 15 minutes. | **1. Non-random pattern detected (e.g., 7 points trending up):** This is a warning. Create a P2 ticket for the development team to investigate a potential performance regression in the next sprint. <br> **2. Point outside UCL:** This is a critical alert. The on-call engineer must investigate immediately. If necessary, roll back the last deployment. |

### Example Control Chart for p99 Latency

This control chart would be displayed on a dashboard for the SRE team.

```
  p99 Latency |
      (ms)    |
        3500 -|---------------------------------------------------------------------- Upper Control Limit (UCL)
              |
        3000 -|---------------------------------------------------------------------- Specification Limit (USL)
              |         *   *       *
        2500 -|-----*-------*---*-------*------------------------------------------ Center Line (CL)
              |   *       *       *   *
        2000 -|
              |
        1500 -|---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower Control Limit (LCL)
              |
              +----------------------------------------------------------------------->
                Time (15-minute intervals)
```

**How the Control Chart is Used:**

*   **Monitoring Stability:** As long as the points are randomly distributed between the UCL and LCL, the team knows the process is stable and in control.
*   **Proactive Warning:** If the chart shows a trend (e.g., the latency is slowly creeping up towards the UCL, even if it hasn't crossed it yet), the team can take proactive action *before* the SLO is breached.
*   **Distinguishing Signal from Noise:** A single slow request might be random noise. A point outside the control limits is a statistically significant signal that something has changed in the process and requires investigation.

### Conclusion

The Process Control Plan is the final and most critical step in ensuring the long-term success of the DFLSS project. For GitVan v3, it provides a concrete plan for:

*   **Sustaining Performance:** Continuously monitoring the production environment to ensure the SLOs we designed are being met.
*   **Data-Driven Operations:** Using statistical process control (SPC) to manage the live system.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Providing the data and signals needed to identify when the process needs to be improved.

This plan ensures that the quality, reliability, and performance that were carefully designed into GitVan v3 are not just a one-time achievement at launch, but are maintained throughout the entire lifecycle of the product.
