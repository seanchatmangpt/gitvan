### ‚ö° [performance-criteria.md](./performance-criteria.md)
Performance targets and benchmarking framework:
- **Primary Metrics**: TTFW <10min, p95 ‚â§300ms, p99 ‚â§800ms, daemon startup ‚â§5s
- **Test Categories**: Micro-benchmarks, integration benchmarks, load testing, stress testing
- **Monitoring**: Continuous performance regression detection, dashboard, optimization guidelines
- **Environments**: Development (MacBook Pro M2), CI (GitHub Actions), Production-like (AWS EC2)

### üîß [integration-tests.md](./integration-tests.md)
Real-world integration test scenarios:
- **Git Integration**: Core operations, signed commits, worktree operations
- **CI/CD Platforms**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins compatibility
- **Container Integration**: Docker, Podman execution environments
- **External Tools**: Package managers (npm/yarn/pnpm), template engines
- **Network Integration**: Remote repositories, push/pull operations
- **Security Integration**: Policy enforcement, command restrictions
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility

### ü§ñ [validation-scripts.md](./validation-scripts.md)
Automated validation scripts for continuous compliance:
- **Structure Validators**: Single-package architecture compliance
- **Dependency Checkers**: Minimal dependencies, security audit
- **API Contract Validators**: Public API specification compliance
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated performance testing
- **Master Runner**: Complete validation suite execution

## Usage

### Quick Validation
```bash
# Run complete validation suite
./specs/validation/validate-all.sh

# Run specific validations
node specs/validation/validate-project-structure.mjs
node specs/validation/validate-dependencies.mjs
node specs/validation/validate-api-contracts.mjs
node specs/validation/run-performance-benchmarks.mjs
```

### Continuous Integration
The validation framework integrates with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validation.yml
- name: Run GitVan v2 Validation Suite
  run: |
    chmod +x specs/validation/validate-all.sh
    specs/validation/validate-all.sh
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Before Implementation**: Review acceptance tests and compliance matrix
2. **During Development**: Run structure and API contract validators
3. **Before Commit**: Execute complete validation suite
4. **Before Release**: Run full integration and performance testing

## Validation Levels

### Level 1: Structure and Contracts
- ‚úÖ Project structure compliance
- ‚úÖ Dependency validation
- ‚úÖ API contract verification
- ‚úÖ TypeScript definition validation

### Level 2: Functional Testing
- ‚úÖ Acceptance test scenarios
- ‚úÖ Job execution validation
- ‚úÖ Event processing verification
- ‚úÖ Composables functionality

### Level 3: Performance and Integration
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarking
- ‚úÖ Integration testing
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform validation
- ‚úÖ Security policy enforcement

### Level 4: Risk and Compliance
- ‚úÖ Risk assessment framework
- ‚úÖ Security validation
- ‚úÖ Audit trail verification
- ‚úÖ Compliance reporting

## Key Validation Points from v2.md

### Architecture Requirements
- ‚úÖ Single package structure (no monorepo)
- ‚úÖ Git-only runtime with no external database
- ‚úÖ ESM modules with TypeScript definitions
- ‚úÖ Node.js + Git dependencies only

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ defineJob() with kind/meta/run structure
- ‚úÖ Composables via unctx (useGit, useTemplate, useExec)
- ‚úÖ Event-driven execution with filesystem routing
- ‚úÖ Nunjucks templates with deterministic rendering
- ‚úÖ Atomic locks with once-only execution semantics

### Worktree Support
- ‚úÖ Per-worktree daemon execution
- ‚úÖ Worktree-scoped locks and receipts
- ‚úÖ Shared repository state in common gitdir
- ‚úÖ CLI worktree selection (--worktrees flag)

### Security and Audit
- ‚úÖ Signed commit verification
- ‚úÖ Command execution allow-lists
- ‚úÖ Immutable receipts in git notes
- ‚úÖ Separation of duties support

### Performance Targets
- ‚úÖ Local job execution p95 ‚â§ 300ms
- ‚úÖ Local job execution p99 ‚â§ 800ms
- ‚úÖ Memory usage ‚â§ 50MB steady state
- ‚úÖ Time to first working < 10 minutes

## Quality Gates
