# Define: Project Charter & MGPP

## GitVan v3.0 Project Charter

**Project Name:** GitVan v3.0 "Autonomic Intelligence"

**Date:** September 19, 2025

**Project Sponsor:** Engineering Director

**Project Lead:** DFLSS Black Belt Team

--- 

**1. Business Case:**

GitVan v2.0.1 has a solid foundation as a Git-native automation tool. However, user feedback and competitive analysis indicate a significant opportunity to move beyond simple automation to a fully autonomous system. The current implementation has several gaps, including missing AI SDK dependencies, incomplete features, and a test coverage deficit. The v3.0 project will address these gaps and introduce breakthrough capabilities, establishing GitVan as a market leader in intelligent development workflows and driving a projected 10x increase in active users.

**2. Vision Statement:**

> "Transform GitVan from a powerful automation tool into an autonomous development partner that understands, learns from, and evolves with your development patterns - requiring zero configuration and delivering maximum value from day one."

**3. Project Goals (SMART):**

*   **Strategic:** Achieve market leadership as a top-3 Git automation tool by delivering a fully autonomous, AI-driven development ecosystem by the end of Q3 2025.
*   **Technical:** Achieve 95%+ test coverage, reduce startup time to <2s, and reduce memory footprint to <100MB by the end of Q1 2025.
*   **User Experience:** Reduce setup time to <30 seconds and the learning curve to <1 hour for productive usage upon launch.
*   **Business:** Acquire 50+ new enterprise customers and grow the community to 1000+ GitHub stars within 6 months of launch.

**4. Project Scope:**

*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Addressing all critical gaps identified in the v2.0.1 Current State Analysis.
    *   Development of a new "Autonomous Intelligence Engine" (self-learning, predictive suggestions).
    *   Integration of multiple AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic).
    *   Implementation of enterprise-grade features (SSO, audit logging, team workspaces).
    *   Creation of a new web-based dashboard and VS Code extension.

*   **Out-of-Scope:**
    *   Full migration support for competing automation platforms.
    *   On-premise enterprise appliance (v3 is cloud/local first).
    *   Mobile application interface.

**5. Key Stakeholders:**

*   Individual Developers (Primary Users)
*   Development Teams (Secondary Users)
*   Enterprise Customers (Key Growth Market)
*   Product Manager
*   Engineering Director
*   Lead Developer, AI Engineer, Frontend Developer

**6. High-Level Timeline & Milestones:**

*   **Phase 1: Foundation Solidification (Q1 2025):** Address v2.0.1 gaps. Target: March 31, 2025.
*   **Phase 2: Autonomous Intelligence Engine (Q2 2025):** Implement core v3 features. Target: June 30, 2025.
*   **Phase 3: Enterprise Features & UX (Q3 2025):** Build enterprise and developer experience features. Target: September 30, 2025.
*   **Launch:** End of Q3 2025.

**7. Budget:**

*   **Total Estimated Budget:** $575,000
    *   Development (Salaries): $500,000
    *   Infrastructure (Cloud, Tools): $50,000
    *   Marketing: $25,000

## Multi-Generational Project Plan (MGPP)

The MGPP places the v3.0 project in the context of the product's long-term evolution.

| Generation | Version | Codename | Core Focus | Key Technologies | Business Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gen 1** | v1.x | "Workflow" | Basic Git workflow automation | Shell scripts, Basic Hooks | Prove concept, initial user base |
| **Gen 2** | v2.x | "Composable Intelligence" | Composable architecture, initial AI integration | UnJS (hookable, citty), Ollama | Establish a flexible, extensible platform |
| **Gen 3 (Current)** | **v3.x** | **"Autonomic Intelligence"** | **Fully autonomous, self-learning workflows** | **AI-driven RDF/SPARQL, Microservices** | **Achieve market leadership, enterprise adoption** |
| **Gen 4** | v4.x | "Swarm Intelligence" | Decentralized, multi-agent development swarms | CRDTs, P2P networking | Redefine collaborative development |

This plan shows that v3.0 is not an endpoint but a critical step towards a larger vision of truly intelligent, collaborative development environments. It builds directly on the composable architecture of v2 and lays the groundwork for the decentralized systems of v4.
