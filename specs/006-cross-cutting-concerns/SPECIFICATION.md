# Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Intent

Define system-wide concerns that span multiple components including error handling, logging, security, performance monitoring, and operational requirements. These concerns should be consistently implemented across all GitVan components while maintaining the system's lean, happy-path philosophy.

## User Stories

**As a system administrator**, I want consistent error handling across all components so that I can predict and manage failure scenarios effectively.

**As a developer debugging issues**, I want structured logging with appropriate detail levels so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

**As a security-conscious user**, I want safe execution of commands and templates so that malicious content cannot compromise my system.

**As a performance-monitoring operator**, I want execution metrics and resource usage data so that I can optimize system performance and capacity planning.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns across all components
- [ ] Structured logging with configurable verbosity levels
- [ ] Security measures preventing code injection and unsafe operations
- [ ] Performance monitoring with execution metrics collection
- [ ] Resource management preventing memory leaks and runaway processes
- [ ] Configuration validation and environment setup verification
- [ ] Graceful degradation under resource constraints
- [ ] Operational tooling for monitoring and troubleshooting

## Out of Scope

- Complex distributed tracing or observability platforms
- Advanced security scanning or vulnerability assessment
- Real-time performance optimization or auto-scaling
- Comprehensive audit logging or compliance features
- Multi-tenant security or access control systems

## Dependencies

- Node.js built-in logging and error handling
- System process management capabilities
- File system access for logging and configuration
- Git repository security model
- Operating system security primitives

## Success Metrics

- Error recovery rate: 95%+ of recoverable errors handled gracefully
- Log noise ratio: < 1% false positive errors in normal operation
- Security incident rate: 0 code injection or privilege escalation incidents
- Performance overhead: < 5% additional latency from monitoring
- Resource leak rate: 0 memory leaks in 24+ hour operation
