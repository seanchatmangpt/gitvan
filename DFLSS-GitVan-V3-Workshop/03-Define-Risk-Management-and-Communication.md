# Define: Risk Management & Communication Plan

## GitVan v3.0 Risk Management Plan

This document outlines the initial risk assessment for the GitVan v3.0 project. We use a simple Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach to identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential risks.

| Risk Category | Potential Failure Mode | Potential Effects | Severity (1-5) | Occurrence (1-5) | Detection (1-5) | RPN | Mitigation Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical** | AI Model API Changes | Key features of the Autonomous Intelligence Engine could break or become obsolete. | 5 | 3 | 4 | 60 | **Mitigation:** Implement a multi-provider strategy (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic) with a local model fallback. Abstract the AI provider interface to minimize the impact of changes. |
| **Technical** | Performance Regression | New features in the workflow engine could slow down core operations, impacting user experience. | 4 | 3 | 2 | 24 | **Mitigation:** Implement continuous performance monitoring and automated benchmarks in the CI/CD pipeline. Set strict performance budgets for all new features. |
| **Execution** | Timeline Delays | Key phases (e.g., Autonomous Intelligence Engine) could be delayed, pushing back the launch date. | 4 | 4 | 2 | 32 | **Mitigation:** Adopt an agile development methodology with regular milestone reviews. Focus on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for each phase. |
| **Market** | Low User Adoption | The new autonomous features may not be compelling enough for users to upgrade from v2 or switch from competitors. | 5 | 2 | 3 | 30 | **Mitigation:** Conduct user research and run a beta testing program with 100 users to gather feedback early. Develop a strong content marketing plan with tutorials and case studies. |
| **Technical** | Security Vulnerabilities | The move to a microservices architecture and increased network communication could introduce new security risks. | 5 | 2 | 2 | 20 | **Mitigation:** Schedule regular security audits and implement automated vulnerability scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. Adhere to security best practices for all new services. |
| **Execution** | Scope Creep | The project's ambitious vision could lead to adding un-planned features, causing delays and budget overruns. | 3 | 4 | 2 | 24 | **Mitigation:** Enforce a strict feature prioritization process based on the approved project charter. All changes to scope must go through a formal change control process. |

**RPN (Risk Priority Number)** = Severity x Occurrence x Detection

## GitVan v3.0 Communication Plan

This plan outlines the communication strategy for keeping all stakeholders informed throughout the project lifecycle.

| Audience | Communication Goal | Channel(s) | Frequency | Owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Project Team** (Devs, PM, QA) | Ensure alignment, resolve blockers, track progress. | - Daily Standup<br>- Team Chat (Slack)<br>- Weekly Sprint Review | Daily / Weekly | Project Lead |
| **Engineering Director** (Sponsor) | Provide high-level status updates, escalate critical issues, review budget. | - Bi-weekly 1:1 Meeting<br>- Monthly Project Review | Bi-weekly / Monthly | Project Lead |
| **Internal Stakeholders** (Marketing, Sales, Support) | Keep them informed of project progress, key features, and launch timeline. | - Monthly Email Update<br>- Quarterly All-Hands Demo | Monthly / Quarterly | Product Manager |
| **Beta Testers** | Gather feedback, report bugs, validate features. | - Private Discord/Slack Channel<br>- Beta Program Newsletter | As needed | Community Manager |
| **External Community** (Users, Open Source Contributors) | Build excitement, share progress, encourage contributions. | - Public GitHub Repository<br>- Reddit / Hacker News<br>- Technical Blog Posts | Monthly / As needed | Developer Advocate |

### Key Communication Artifacts:

*   **Project Charter:** The single source of truth for project scope and goals. (Stored in project repository)
*   **Milestone Reviews:** A presentation at the end of each phase to demonstrate progress and get stakeholder buy-in.
*   **Launch Announcement:** A coordinated marketing effort to announce the GA release of v3.0.
