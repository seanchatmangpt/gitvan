# GitVan v2 Implementation Delta Report

## Executive Summary
This document identifies the gap between what was claimed as "implemented" versus what actually exists in the codebase. After applying the test-fix-verify loop mandated by the updated CLAUDE.md, significant gaps were discovered.

## üî¥ Critical Finding
**The implementation was reported as 95% complete, but actual testing reveals only ~70% is truly functional.**

---

## 1. CLI Commands

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
| Command | Location | Current State | Required Work |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| `gitvan job list` | src/cli.mjs:164 | Returns "Job listing not yet implemented" | Need to implement job discovery from subcommand context |
| `gitvan job run --name` | src/cli.mjs:175 | Has TODO comment, partial implementation | Need to complete job execution from subcommand |
| `gitvan schedule apply` | src/cli.mjs:112 | Returns "Schedule management not yet implemented" | Need cron-like scheduling system |

### ‚úÖ Actually Working
- `gitvan help` - Shows help text
- `gitvan list` - Lists available jobs (legacy)
- `gitvan run <job>` - Executes jobs successfully
- `gitvan event list` - Lists discovered events
- `gitvan worktree list` - Shows worktrees
- `gitvan daemon status` - Reports daemon status

---

## 2. Execution Types

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
| Exec Type | Status | Location | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| `exec: 'llm'` | Framework only | src/composables/exec.mjs | No Ollama client integration |
| `exec: 'job'` | Framework only | src/composables/exec.mjs | No job chaining logic |

### ‚úÖ Actually Working
- `exec: 'cli'` - Command execution works
- `exec: 'js'` - Module import and execution works
- `exec: 'tmpl'` - Nunjucks template rendering works

---

## 3. Daemon Implementation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
| Feature | Status | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Daemon start | Partial | Creates PID file but polling loop not fully tested |
| Daemon stop | Partial | Removes PID file but no process management |
| Multi-worktree | Framework | Loop exists but not tested with actual worktrees |
| Event matching | Framework | `eventFires()` referenced but not implemented |
| Polling loop | Framework | Structure exists but untested |

---

## 4. Lock System

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Framework Only
| Feature | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `acquireLock()` | src/runtime/locks.mjs | Function exists but untested |
| `releaseLock()` | src/runtime/locks.mjs | Function exists but untested |
| `worktreeLockRef()` | src/runtime/locks.mjs | Function exists but untested |
| Atomic refs | Not verified | No tests for race conditions |

---

## 5. Receipt System

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Framework Only
| Feature | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `writeReceipt()` | src/runtime/receipt.mjs | Function exists but untested |
| `readReceipts()` | src/runtime/receipt.mjs | Function exists but untested |
| Git notes integration | Not verified | No verification of actual note creation |

---

## 6. Event System

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
| Feature | Status | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Event discovery | Works | Finds .mjs files but treats ALL as events |
| Event routing | Not implemented | No pattern matching for cron/merge-to/etc |
| Event predicates | Not implemented | No `eventFires()` function |
| Event binding | Not implemented | No job binding from event files |

### Current Behavior
The `gitvan event list` command finds ALL .mjs files (including node_modules!) and lists them as events, which is incorrect.

---

## 7. Missing Core Functions

### Functions Referenced But Not Implemented
1. **`eventFires(note, sha)`** - Referenced in daemon.mjs:133 but doesn't exist
2. **`runExec(note.run)`** - Referenced but not properly integrated
3. **Schedule management** - No cron parsing or scheduling logic
4. **Job discovery from subcommands** - The job subcommand context is broken

---

## 8. Git Operations

### ‚úÖ Actually Working
All 40+ Git operations in `src/composables/git.mjs` appear to be properly implemented with correct Git command wrapping.

---

## 9. Template System

### ‚úÖ Actually Working
Nunjucks integration is functional with:
- Template rendering
- File output
- Deterministic helpers
- Git context injection

---

## 10. Configuration System

### ‚úÖ Actually Working
Configuration loading from `gitvan.config.js` works with proper defaults and merging.

---

## Summary Statistics

### Implementation Status by Component
| Component | Claimed | Actual | Delta |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| CLI Commands | 100% | 60% | -40% |
| Execution Types | 100% | 60% | -40% |
| Daemon | 100% | 30% | -70% |
| Lock System | 100% | 20% | -80% |
| Receipt System | 100% | 20% | -80% |
| Event System | 100% | 30% | -70% |
| Git Operations | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Template System | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Configuration | 100% | 100% | 0% |

### Overall Implementation
- **Claimed**: 95% complete
- **Actual**: ~70% complete
- **Delta**: -25% functionality gap

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why the Gap Exists
1. **No Test-First Development** - Implementation was written without running tests
2. **Framework vs Implementation** - Many functions exist but aren't wired up
3. **Missing Integration** - Components don't properly call each other
4. **Incomplete Error Handling** - Happy path only, no error cases handled
5. **Copy-Paste from v2.md** - Code was copied from spec without implementation

### Lessons Learned
1. **Always test before claiming completion**
2. **Use the 80/20 test-fix-verify loop**
3. **Don't trust "it should work" - verify it does work**
4. **Framework code is not implementation**
5. **Integration is as important as individual functions**

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1 (Core Functionality)
1. Fix `gitvan job list` and `gitvan job run --name` subcommands
2. Implement proper event pattern matching
3. Wire up lock and receipt systems
4. Test daemon polling loop

### Priority 2 (Critical Features)
1. Implement `eventFires()` function
2. Add schedule management
3. Test multi-worktree support
4. Add LLM integration

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
1. Add error handling throughout
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Create integration tests
4. Add performance monitoring

## Conclusion

The GitVan v2 implementation has a solid foundation with working Git operations, templates, and configuration. However, critical components like the daemon, locks, receipts, and event system are only partially implemented. The test-fix-verify loop revealed that approximately 25% of the claimed functionality doesn't actually work.

**Key Takeaway**: Without actual testing, it's impossible to know what truly works. The updated CLAUDE.md now enforces this discipline to prevent future false completion reports.
