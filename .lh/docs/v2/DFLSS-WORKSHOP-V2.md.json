Success is signed in Git notes.\n* We framed the system as a Git-native workflow engine; Git is the single source of truth and runtime.\n\n**MEASURE**\n\n* We operationalized Y=f(X): Y = {latency, audit time, receipt coverage}; X = {FS routing, locks, template speed, git ops}.\n* We built a baseline with control charts (XmR) for job latency; special causes were I/O spikes and shell variance.\n* We validated measurement with MSA: timers, clocks (UTC), and deterministic seeds.\n* We computed process capability (Cp/Cpk) for job runtime on target hardware.\n\n**EXPLORE**\n\n* We generated concepts using TRIZ: remove central queue (Segmentation), push intelligence to Git (Self-service), replace DB with notes (Substitution).\n* We used Pugh/AHP to select architecture: composables + Nunjucks + git-notes beat alternatives on speed and auditability.\n* We ran Monte Carlo on cron density and lock collision; jitter + per-worktree scoping reduces collision tail risk.\n* We formed hypotheses: “Inflection filters reduce template code; fewer defects.” “Atomic `update-ref` guarantees once-only.”\n\n**DEVELOP**\n\n* We designed for robustness: deterministic env (TZ, LANG, seeds), sandboxed paths, idempotent git ops.\n* We performed 2-way ANOVA on latency by OS×Shell; interaction existed; we standardized shells and trimmed path lookups.\n* We ran full-factorial DOE on `log format × batch size × buffer strategy`; optimal set hit p95 goal.\n* We added curvature (RSM) for executor concurrency; a shallow maximum avoided thrash.\n* We conducted DFMEA: top failure modes were lock race, path traversal, and non-serializable receipts; controls were atomic refs, canonicalization, and schema guards.\n* We applied DFM/DFA: compress dependencies; prefer built-ins; reduce branching in hot path.\n\n**IMPLEMENT**\n\n* We piloted prototypes and a playground. We executed prototype→pilot→production with gated merges.\n* We froze the recipe set (80/20 dark matter) and verified receipts across platforms.\n* We embedded process controls: preflight checks, policy hooks, and signed release tags.\n* We created an implementation plan with backout paths and “audit pack” generation.\n\n**STATISTICS & TESTING**\n\n* We used hypothesis tests (t, Mann–Whitney) to show latency improvement vs. baseline.\n* We used regression to relate latency to repo size and file count; we tuned scan strategies accordingly.\n* We applied χ² to failure type distribution pre/post controls; significant defect mix shift confirmed control effectiveness.\n\n**LEAN PRINCIPLES**\n\n* We removed waste: no external DB, no central queue, no bespoke schedulers where cron sufficed.\n* We designed for flow: FS discovery → route → lock → run → receipt; no rework loops.\n* We used visual controls: changelog jobs render status; receipts make invisible work visible.\n\n**RELIABILITY**\n\n* We treated LLM calls as nondeterministic; we captured seeds, parameters, and output hashes.\n* We built compensation paths and retries with backoff; we separated “fire-and-forget” from “must-confirm.”\n\n**DECISIONS (QFD Trace)**\n\n* Composables map directly to VOC features; template performance ranked highest by weight and drove Nunjucks choice.\n* Git-notes receipts scored highest on audit and neutrality; adopted as canonical proof.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n* CTQs met: p95 ≤ 300 ms, TTFJ < 10 min, 100% receipts, audit ≤ 5 min.\n* Variation reduced; control limits stable across pilots; capability indices acceptable for GA.\n\n**META-HEURISTICS**\n\n* Prefer primitives over platforms. Prefer content-addressed artifacts over mutable state. Prefer receipts over logs.\n* If a step cannot be proven, it did not happen. If a config is not in Git, it does not exist.\n\n**CAPSTONE OUTPUTS**\n\n* Charter, MGPP, risk register, comms plan.\n* CTQ matrix, QFD, spec sheets, DOE notebooks, ANOVA/RSM summaries.\n* DFMEA with actions closed. Control plan embedded in CLI and daemon.\n* Pilot report with capability, stability, and audit packs.\n\n**ANALOGIES**\n\n* Git is the kanban board and the factory ledger. Commits are work units; refs are conveyors; notes are certificates.\n* Locks are andons; receipts are travelers. Templates are jigs; composables are fixtures.\n\n**CLOSING ASSERTION**\n\n* A Git-native, Lean Six Sigma–designed engine turns invisible developer “dark matter” into measured, auditable flow with minimal variance and maximal trust.\n"
