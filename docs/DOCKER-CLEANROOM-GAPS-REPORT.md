# Docker Cleanroom Test Gaps Report

**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Test Environment:** Docker cleanroom with Node.js 20 Alpine  
**GitVan Version:** 2.1.0  

## Executive Summary

The Docker cleanroom test successfully demonstrates that GitVan can initialize a project in a containerized environment, but reveals significant gaps between the documented functionality in the README and the actual implementation. While the initialization process works correctly, many of the advertised features are not available in the current CLI implementation.

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ What Works in Docker Cleanroom

1. **Project Initialization**
   - ✅ Docker image builds successfully
   - ✅ GitVan init command runs without errors
   - ✅ All directory structure is created correctly
   - ✅ Configuration files are generated properly
   - ✅ Sample files are created (hooks, workflows, templates)

2. **File Structure Created**
   ```
   test-output/
   ├── .git/                    ✅ Git repository initialized
   ├── .gitvan/                 ✅ GitVan state directory
   ├── gitvan.config.js         ✅ Configuration file
   ├── package.json             ✅ NPM package file
   ├── graph/init.ttl           ✅ Knowledge graph
   ├── hooks/                   ✅ Sample hooks
   ├── workflows/               ✅ Sample workflows
   ├── templates/               ✅ Sample templates
   └── tests/                   ✅ Test directories
   ```

3. **Configuration Quality**
   - ✅ `gitvan.config.js` contains comprehensive configuration
   - ✅ `package.json` includes proper scripts and dependencies
   - ✅ Knowledge graph follows proper Turtle syntax
   - ✅ Sample hooks use correct RDF/SPARQL syntax
   - ✅ Sample workflows demonstrate proper structure

### ❌ Critical Gaps Identified

## 1. CLI Command Mismatch

**Issue:** The README documents commands that don't exist in the actual CLI implementation.

### README Claims vs Reality

| README Command | Actual Status | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| `gitvan hooks list` | ❌ **Unknown command** | CLI shows "Unknown command: hooks" |
| `gitvan hooks evaluate` | ❌ **Unknown command** | Not implemented |
| `gitvan workflow list` | ❌ **Unknown command** | CLI shows "Unknown command: workflow" |
| `gitvan workflow run` | ❌ **Unknown command** | Not implemented |
| `gitvan setup` | ❌ **Unknown command** | CLI shows "Unknown command: setup" |

### Actual Available Commands
The CLI only supports these commands:
- `gitvan init` ✅
- `gitvan daemon [start|stop|status]`
- `gitvan job [list|run]`
- `gitvan event [list|simulate|test]`
- `gitvan cron [list|start|dry-run]`
- `gitvan audit [build|verify|list]`
- `gitvan chat [draft|generate|explain]`
- `gitvan llm [call|models]`
- `gitvan pack [list|apply|plan|remove|update|status]`
- `gitvan scaffold <pack:scaffold>`
- `gitvan marketplace [browse|search|inspect|quickstart]`
- `gitvan marketplace-scan [index|scan|status|config]`
- `gitvan compose <pack1> <pack2>`
- `gitvan save [--message <msg>]`
- `gitvan schedule apply`
- `gitvan worktree list`

## 2. Package.json Script Issues

**Issue:** The generated `package.json` includes scripts that reference non-existent commands.

### Problematic Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "hooks:list": "gitvan hooks list",        // ❌ Command doesn't exist
    "hooks:evaluate": "gitvan hooks evaluate", // ❌ Command doesn't exist
    "workflows:list": "gitvan workflow list", // ❌ Command doesn't exist
    "workflows:run": "gitvan workflow run",    // ❌ Command doesn't exist
    "setup": "gitvan setup"                    // ❌ Command doesn't exist
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Users cannot run these scripts as they will fail with "Unknown command" errors.

## 3. Knowledge Hook Engine Implementation Gap

**Issue:** While the README extensively documents the Knowledge Hook Engine with examples of:
- ResultDelta predicates
- ASK predicates  
- SELECTThreshold predicates
- SHACL validation predicates

**Reality:** There are no CLI commands to interact with these hooks, making the entire Knowledge Hook Engine non-functional from a user perspective.

## 4. Turtle Workflow Engine Implementation Gap

**Issue:** The README documents Turtle as a workflow engine with:
- Declarative workflows in Turtle format
- DAG execution with topological sorting
- Template processing with Nunjucks
- SPARQL integration

**Reality:** No CLI commands exist to run or manage these workflows, despite sample files being created.

## 5. Docker Cleanroom Command Mismatch

**Issue:** README shows Docker usage as:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace gitvan-cleanroom
```

**Reality:** The Dockerfile has no entrypoint, and the test script manually runs the init command. The documented Docker usage would not work.

## 6. Missing Dependencies

**Issue:** The generated `package.json` references `gitvan@^2.1.0` as a dependency, but:
- No `node_modules` directory is created during initialization
- The dependency is not actually installed
- Users would need to manually run `npm install` to get dependencies

## Detailed Analysis

### Initialization Process Analysis

The initialization process (`gitvan init`) works correctly and creates:
1. **Proper directory structure** - All required directories are created
2. **Valid configuration files** - `gitvan.config.js` contains comprehensive settings
3. **Sample content** - Hooks, workflows, and templates are created with proper syntax
4. **Git repository** - Git is initialized (though with warnings about user identity)

### Configuration Quality Assessment

The generated `gitvan.config.js` is comprehensive and includes:
- ✅ Template configuration
- ✅ Job configuration  
- ✅ Event configuration
- ✅ Pack configuration
- ✅ Hook configuration (with autoEvaluate: true)
- ✅ Workflow configuration
- ✅ Knowledge graph configuration
- ✅ Daemon configuration
- ✅ AI configuration (Ollama)
- ✅ Custom data injection

### Sample File Quality Assessment

**Hooks (`hooks/version-change.ttl`):**
- ✅ Proper RDF/Turtle syntax
- ✅ Correct namespace usage
- ✅ Valid SPARQL queries
- ✅ Proper hook structure with predicates and pipelines

**Workflows (`workflows/data-processing.ttl`):**
- ✅ Proper RDF/Turtle syntax
- ✅ Valid workflow definition
- ✅ Correct step dependencies
- ✅ Template integration

**Templates (`templates/project-status.njk`):**
- ✅ Valid Nunjucks syntax
- ✅ Proper filter usage
- ✅ Good documentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix CLI Command Implementation**
   - Implement missing `hooks` subcommand
   - Implement missing `workflow` subcommand  
   - Implement missing `setup` subcommand
   - Update help text to reflect actual capabilities

2. **Fix Package.json Scripts**
   - Remove or replace non-functional scripts
   - Only include scripts for commands that actually exist
   - Add proper error handling

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Remove references to non-existent commands
   - Update Docker usage instructions
   - Clarify what features are actually implemented vs planned

4. **Fix Dependency Installation**
   - Automatically run `npm install` during initialization
   - Or provide clear instructions for manual installation

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Complete Knowledge Hook Engine Implementation**
   - Implement hook evaluation logic
   - Add CLI commands for hook management
   - Create hook execution engine

2. **Complete Turtle Workflow Engine Implementation**
   - Implement workflow execution engine
   - Add CLI commands for workflow management
   - Create workflow scheduling system

3. **Improve Docker Integration**
   - Add proper entrypoint to Dockerfile
   - Create working Docker usage examples
   - Test Docker functionality end-to-end

## Conclusion

The Docker cleanroom test reveals that while GitVan's initialization process is robust and creates a well-structured project, there is a significant disconnect between the documented features and the actual implementation. The Knowledge Hook Engine and Turtle Workflow Engine, which are prominently featured in the README, are not accessible through the CLI, making them effectively non-functional for end users.

**Priority:** High - The documentation promises functionality that doesn't exist, which will lead to user frustration and loss of trust.

**Impact:** Users following the README will encounter multiple "Unknown command" errors and be unable to use the core advertised features.

**Recommendation:** Either implement the missing functionality or update the documentation to accurately reflect what is currently available.
