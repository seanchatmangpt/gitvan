```javascript
describe('FS Router System', () => {
  test('should discover events from filesystem', async () => {
    // Given: A repository with events/ directory
    const repo = await createTestRepo({
      'events/merge-to/main.mjs': `
        export default async function handler({ payload, git, meta }) {
          return { ok: true, action: 'deploy' }
        }
      `
    })
    
    // When: Scanning for events
    const events = await discoverEvents(repo.root)
    
    // Then: Events should be discoverable
    expect(events).toHaveLength(1)
    expect(events[0].pattern).toBe('merge-to/main')
  })
})
```

## Claude-Generated Specification Review

### Architecture Analysis
The file system-based routing approach is well-suited for GitVan v2's convention-over-configuration philosophy.

### Performance Analysis
The performance targets are realistic and achievable:
- Event discovery < 100ms: Achievable with efficient file system scanning
- Route matching < 10ms: Achievable with proper caching and optimization

### Security Analysis
The security contracts address key concerns:
- Path traversal prevention: Critical for file system-based routing
- File permissions validation: Important for multi-user environments
```

### Phase 3: Stakeholder Collaboration
