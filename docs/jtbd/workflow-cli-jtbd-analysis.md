## London BDD Implementation

### BDD Scenarios Structure

Each JTBD is tested through comprehensive BDD scenarios that focus on:

1. **Given** - Initial state and context setup
2. **When** - Action execution (user job performance)
3. **Then** - Outcome verification (job success criteria)

### Scenario Categories

#### Discovery Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: List all available workflows
  Given I have workflow definitions in the "./workflows" directory
  When I run "gitvan workflow list"
  Then the command should succeed
  And I should see a list of available workflows
  And each workflow should show its title and pipeline count
```

#### Validation Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Validate an existing workflow
  Given I have a workflow with ID "http://example.org/test-workflow"
  When I run "gitvan workflow validate http://example.org/test-workflow"
  Then the command should succeed
  And I should see validation success message
  And I should see "Workflow structure is valid"
```

#### Execution Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: Execute workflow in dry-run mode
  Given I have a workflow with ID "http://example.org/test-workflow"
  When I run "gitvan workflow run http://example.org/test-workflow --dry-run"
  Then the command should succeed
  And I should see "Dry run mode - no actual execution"
  And I should see "Workflow found"
```
