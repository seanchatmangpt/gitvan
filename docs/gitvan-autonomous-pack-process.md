# GitVan Pack Process - Autonomous Hyper-Intelligence Perspective

## The Real Problem

The pack should be **autonomous** - it shouldn't care where GitVan is installed or what the absolute paths are. It should work anywhere, anytime.

## Current Flawed Thinking

❌ **Hardcoded Paths**: `file:///Users/sac/gitvan/src/index.mjs`
❌ **Manual Copying**: Copying files to `jobs/` directory
❌ **Installation Dependency**: Pack depends on knowing GitVan's location

## Autonomous Solution

The pack should work like this:

```bash
# 1. Pull pack
npx giget@latest github:seanchatmangpt/gitvan-nextjs-pack
cd gitvan-nextjs-pack

# 2. Pack auto-initializes itself
# 3. Pack auto-registers its jobs
# 4. Pack auto-executes when needed
```

## How It Should Actually Work

### 1. Pack Self-Initialization
The pack should detect it's in a GitVan environment and auto-register itself:

```javascript
// In pack root - auto-init script
if (process.env.GITVAN_ENV || existsSync('.gitvan')) {
  // Auto-register this pack's jobs
  await registerPackJobs();
}
```

### 2. Relative Imports
Jobs should use relative imports that work anywhere:

```javascript
// This should work regardless of GitVan installation path
import { defineJob } from '../../../../src/core/job-registry.mjs';
// OR
import { defineJob } from 'gitvan/job-registry';
```

### 3. Pack Auto-Discovery
GitVan should auto-discover packs and their jobs:

```javascript
// GitVan scans for packs and auto-loads their jobs
const packs = await discoverPacks();
for (const pack of packs) {
  await loadPackJobs(pack);
}
```

### 4. Pack Manifest Integration
The `pack.json` should tell GitVan how to load the jobs:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "name": "create-next-app",
      "file": "create-next-app.job.mjs",
      "autoLoad": true,
      "importPath": "relative"
    }
  ]
}
```

## The Missing Piece

GitVan needs **pack auto-discovery and job auto-loading**. The pack shouldn't require manual steps - it should be intelligent enough to:

1. **Detect** it's a GitVan pack
2. **Register** its jobs automatically  
3. **Execute** when called
4. **Work** regardless of installation path

## Current State Analysis

The pack works with giget ✅
The pack has correct structure ✅
The pack has jobs ✅
**BUT** the pack requires manual intervention ❌

## What's Missing

GitVan needs:
1. **Pack Discovery**: Auto-find packs in the filesystem
2. **Job Auto-Loading**: Auto-load jobs from discovered packs
3. **Relative Import Resolution**: Handle imports correctly
4. **Pack Lifecycle**: Initialize → Register → Execute

The pack should be **autonomous** - it should work without human intervention, just like an autonomous hyper-intelligence would expect.
