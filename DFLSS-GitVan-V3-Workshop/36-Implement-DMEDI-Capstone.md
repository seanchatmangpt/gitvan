# Implement: DMEDI Capstone Project

## Your Challenge: Design the Future of GitVan

Congratulations on completing the Design for Lean Six Sigma Black Belt course. You have learned the DMEDI methodology and applied its tools to the GitVan v3.0 "Autonomic Intelligence" case study.

For your final capstone project, you will apply everything you have learned to a new challenge: **designing a key feature for the hypothetical GitVan v4.0, codenamed "Swarm Intelligence."**

## Project Background

As outlined in the Multi-Generational Project Plan (MGPP), the vision for GitVan v4.0 is to move beyond single-developer autonomy to **multi-agent, collaborative development swarms**. The goal is to create a system where multiple AI agents can collaborate on a single codebase to solve complex problems, much like a human development team.

**Your Task:** Design the **"AI Swarm Coordinator"** service. This is the central component of the v4.0 vision, responsible for orchestrating the work of multiple AI agents.

## Your Deliverable

You will create a single, comprehensive design document that includes a section for each of the five DMEDI phases. You should use at least **one key tool or concept** from each phase that we covered in the course.

### 1. Define Phase

*   **Create a Project Charter** for the "AI Swarm Coordinator" feature.
    *   Include a business case, a vision statement, SMART goals, and the project scope.
*   **Identify Key Risks** and propose a high-level mitigation plan.

### 2. Measure Phase

*   **Identify the Voice of the Customer (VoC).** Your "customers" are the development team leads who will use this system. What are their primary needs and pain points regarding team collaboration and large-scale task decomposition?
*   **Create a Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) Tree** for the most important customer need. For example, for the need "I need to trust the AI swarm to work efficiently," what are the specific, measurable drivers of that trust?

### 3. Explore Phase

*   **Generate and Select a Concept.** Brainstorm at least two different architectural concepts for the Swarm Coordinator. Create a **Pugh Matrix** to compare them against the CTQs you identified and justify your chosen concept.
*   **Conduct a Design FMEA.** For your chosen concept, identify at least three potential failure modes and complete an FMEA table (including RPN and recommended actions).

### 4. Develop Phase

*   **Design an Experiment (DOE).** Your Swarm Coordinator needs to assign tasks to different AI agents. These agents can have different specializations (e.g., 'Coder', 'Tester', 'Refactorer'). Design a **Full-Factorial DOE** to determine the optimal team composition for a specific task.
    *   **Factors:** % of Coders, % of Testers, % of Refactorers in the swarm.
    *   **Response:** Task Completion Time or Code Quality Score.
    *   You do not need to create the data; just design the experiment matrix and describe what you would learn from the main effects and interactions.
*   **Apply a Reliability Pattern.** Describe one reliability pattern (e.g., Circuit Breaker, Redundancy) that you would apply to your design and explain why.

### 5. Implement Phase

*   **Create a Process Control Plan.** Identify one critical SLO for your Swarm Coordinator service (e.g., `task_completion_rate > 99%`). Create a control plan table specifying how you would monitor this metric and what the reaction plan would be if it goes out of control.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your capstone project will be evaluated on:

*   **Correct Application of DFLSS Tools:** Your ability to correctly choose and apply at least one tool from each DMEDI phase.
*   **Clarity and Justification:** The clarity of your writing and the logic behind your design decisions.
*   **Integration:** How well the different phases of your project connect to form a coherent whole.
*   **Creativity and Insight:** The quality of your ideas for the GitVan v4.0 vision.

This capstone project is your opportunity to demonstrate your mastery of the DFLSS methodology by using it to solve a complex, real-world design challenge. Good luck!
