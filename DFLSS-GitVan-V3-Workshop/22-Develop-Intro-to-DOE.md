# Develop: Intro to Design of Experiments (DOE)

## What is Design of Experiments?

**Design of Experiments (DOE)** is a powerful statistical methodology for planning, conducting, and analyzing experiments. It allows us to systematically and efficiently study the relationship between multiple input variables (or **factors**) and an output variable (or **response**).

Instead of the traditional "one-factor-at-a-time" (OFAT) approach, DOE allows us to change multiple factors at once. This is far more efficient and, crucially, it allows us to identify **interactions** between factors—when the effect of one factor depends on the level of another.

### Why Use DOE?

*   **Efficiency:** Learn the most information from the fewest number of experimental runs.
*   **Factor Screening:** Quickly identify which of many potential factors are the most important.
*   **Optimization:** Find the optimal settings for the key factors to maximize or minimize the response.
*   **Interaction Effects:** Discover non-obvious relationships between factors.

### Key Terms in DOE

*   **Factor:** An independent variable that we control in the experiment (e.g., AI model, temperature).
*   **Level:** A specific setting for a factor (e.g., for the "AI Model" factor, the levels could be 'qwen3' and 'gpt-4o').
*   **Response:** The dependent variable or the outcome of the experiment that we measure (e.g., Quality Score, Latency).
*   **Run:** A single experimental trial conducted at a specific combination of factor levels.
*   **Main Effect:** The effect of a single factor on the response.
*   **Interaction Effect:** The effect when two or more factors together have a different impact on the response than they would individually.

## GitVan v3.0 Case Study Application: Optimizing AI Workflow Generation

The GitVan v3 team wants to optimize the **Quality Score** of the workflows generated by their `AI-Workflow-Generator` service. From their previous work, they have a list of factors they believe might influence the quality of the AI's output.

**The Goal:** Find the combination of factor settings that produces the highest average Quality Score.

### The Factors and Levels

The team identifies three key factors they can control, and they choose two levels for each:

| Factor | Level 1 (-) | Level 2 (+) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A: Model** | `qwen3-coder` | `gpt-4o` | The underlying AI model used for generation. |
| **B: Temperature** | `0.2` (Deterministic) | `0.8` (Creative) | A parameter controlling the randomness of the AI's output. |
| **C: Context** | `Basic` (Prompt only) | `Detailed` (Prompt + Repo Schema) | The amount of contextual information provided to the AI. |

### The Response

*   **Response Variable:** **Quality Score** (0-100), calculated for each generated workflow.

### The Experimental Design

With 3 factors at 2 levels each, a **Full Factorial** experiment would require 2³ = 8 runs. This means testing every possible combination of the factor levels.

In the next module, we will design and analyze this Full Factorial experiment to see how DOE can provide deep insights into the system. DOE will not only tell us which factors are important, but it will also reveal if there are any surprising interactions between them, such as a specific model performing better only when given detailed context.
