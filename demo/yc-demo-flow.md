## 💥 PROBLEM (30 seconds)

### The $45B Development Bottleneck
- **28 million developers** waste 40% of their time on repetitive setup
- **Manual scaffolding** takes hours for what should take seconds
- **Template fragmentation** across platforms creates vendor lock-in
- **Configuration drift** costs enterprises millions in tech debt

*[Show painful manual setup process - multiple commands, configuration files, 5+ minutes of waiting]*

```bash
# The OLD way - painful manual setup
git clone some-template
cd some-template
rm -rf .git
find . -name "*.json" -exec sed -i 's/old-name/new-name/g' {} \;
# ... 20+ more manual steps
# ... 5+ minutes of configuration hell
```

**"This is development in 2024. We can do better."**
