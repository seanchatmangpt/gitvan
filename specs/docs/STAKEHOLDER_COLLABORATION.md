# Stakeholder Collaboration Guide

## Overview

This document defines how GitVan v2 specifications should be structured to facilitate effective collaboration between developers, product managers, system administrators, and other stakeholders.

## Specification Structure for Collaboration

### 1. Executive Summary

Each specification should start with an executive summary that answers:
- **What**: What is being built?
- **Why**: Why is this needed?
- **Impact**: What business value does this provide?
- **Timeline**: When will this be delivered?

```markdown
## Executive Summary

**What**: GitVan v2 Core System - A lean, single-package JavaScript solution for Git-native automation

**Why**: The current monorepo approach adds unnecessary complexity and deployment overhead for a tool that operates as a unified runtime

**Impact**: 
- 50% reduction in deployment complexity
- 80% faster startup times
- Simplified dependency management
- Better developer experience

**Timeline**: 2 weeks for core implementation, 4 weeks for full system
```

### 2. Stakeholder-Specific Sections

#### For Product Managers

```markdown
## Product Impact

### User Stories
- **As a developer**: I want to write automation jobs using familiar JavaScript patterns
- **As a repository maintainer**: I want Git-native automation that doesn't pollute my repository
- **As a system administrator**: I want worktree-scoped daemons with proper locking

### Success Metrics
- Developer adoption: 90% of teams using GitVan v1 migrate to v2 within 6 months
- Performance improvement: 50% faster job execution
- User satisfaction: 4.5+ stars on npm

### Business Value
- Reduced support burden through simplified architecture
- Increased adoption through better developer experience
- Lower operational costs through reduced complexity
```

#### For System Administrators

```markdown
## Operational Considerations

### Deployment
- Single npm package installation
- No external database dependencies
- Git-native storage using refs and notes

### Monitoring
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check endpoints

### Security
- No code injection vulnerabilities
- Signed commit verification
- Command execution constraints

### Maintenance
- Automatic lock cleanup
- Graceful shutdown procedures
- Resource limit enforcement
```

#### For Developers

```markdown
## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Single package with clear module boundaries
- Composables-based API using unctx
- Five execution types: cli, js, llm, job, tmpl

### API Design
```javascript
// Clean, composable API
const git = useGit()
const template = useTemplate()
const exec = useExec()

// Job definition
export default defineJob({
  kind: 'atomic',
  meta: { desc: 'Generate changelog' },
  run: async () => {
    const commits = git.run('log --oneline -50').split('\n')
    template.renderToFile('changelog.njk', 'CHANGELOG.md', { commits })
    return { ok: true, artifact: 'CHANGELOG.md' }
  }
})
```

### Testing Strategy
- Executable specifications with Jest
- Contract testing for API compliance
- Performance testing with Artillery
- Security testing with OWASP ZAP
```
