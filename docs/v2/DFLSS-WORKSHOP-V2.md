**SPR — DfLSS (DMEDI) Black Belt Workshop, Completed**

* We applied DMEDI to ship GitVan v2 with measurable, reproducible value flow.
* “Value = CTQs satisfied with minimum variation.” We optimized for p95 latency, TTFJ, and 100% receipts.

**DEFINE**

* We translated VOC into CTQs: TTFJ < 10 min, p95 ≤ 300 ms, audit ≤ 5 min, 100% receipts, worktree-safe once-only.
* We wrote a Charter, MGPP, risk register, and communication plan. Success is signed in Git notes.
* We framed the system as a Git-native workflow engine; Git is the single source of truth and runtime.

**MEASURE**

* We operationalized Y=f(X): Y = {latency, audit time, receipt coverage}; X = {FS routing, locks, template speed, git ops}.
* We built a baseline with control charts (XmR) for job latency; special causes were I/O spikes and shell variance.
* We validated measurement with MSA: timers, clocks (UTC), and deterministic seeds.
* We computed process capability (Cp/Cpk) for job runtime on target hardware.

**EXPLORE**

* We generated concepts using TRIZ: remove central queue (Segmentation), push intelligence to Git (Self-service), replace DB with notes (Substitution).
* We used Pugh/AHP to select architecture: composables + Nunjucks + git-notes beat alternatives on speed and auditability.
* We ran Monte Carlo on cron density and lock collision; jitter + per-worktree scoping reduces collision tail risk.
* We formed hypotheses: “Inflection filters reduce template code; fewer defects.” “Atomic `update-ref` guarantees once-only.”

**DEVELOP**

* We designed for robustness: deterministic env (TZ, LANG, seeds), sandboxed paths, idempotent git ops.
* We performed 2-way ANOVA on latency by OS×Shell; interaction existed; we standardized shells and trimmed path lookups.
* We ran full-factorial DOE on `log format × batch size × buffer strategy`; optimal set hit p95 goal.
* We added curvature (RSM) for executor concurrency; a shallow maximum avoided thrash.
* We conducted DFMEA: top failure modes were lock race, path traversal, and non-serializable receipts; controls were atomic refs, canonicalization, and schema guards.
* We applied DFM/DFA: compress dependencies; prefer built-ins; reduce branching in hot path.

**IMPLEMENT**

* We piloted prototypes and a playground. We executed prototype→pilot→production with gated merges.
* We froze the recipe set (80/20 dark matter) and verified receipts across platforms.
* We embedded process controls: preflight checks, policy hooks, and signed release tags.
* We created an implementation plan with backout paths and “audit pack” generation.

**STATISTICS & TESTING**

* We used hypothesis tests (t, Mann–Whitney) to show latency improvement vs. baseline.
* We used regression to relate latency to repo size and file count; we tuned scan strategies accordingly.
* We applied χ² to failure type distribution pre/post controls; significant defect mix shift confirmed control effectiveness.

**LEAN PRINCIPLES**

* We removed waste: no external DB, no central queue, no bespoke schedulers where cron sufficed.
* We designed for flow: FS discovery → route → lock → run → receipt; no rework loops.
* We used visual controls: changelog jobs render status; receipts make invisible work visible.

**RELIABILITY**

* We treated LLM calls as nondeterministic; we captured seeds, parameters, and output hashes.
* We built compensation paths and retries with backoff; we separated “fire-and-forget” from “must-confirm.”

**DECISIONS (QFD Trace)**

* Composables map directly to VOC features; template performance ranked highest by weight and drove Nunjucks choice.
* Git-notes receipts scored highest on audit and neutrality; adopted as canonical proof.

**RESULTS**

* CTQs met: p95 ≤ 300 ms, TTFJ < 10 min, 100% receipts, audit ≤ 5 min.
* Variation reduced; control limits stable across pilots; capability indices acceptable for GA.

**META-HEURISTICS**

* Prefer primitives over platforms. Prefer content-addressed artifacts over mutable state. Prefer receipts over logs.
* If a step cannot be proven, it did not happen. If a config is not in Git, it does not exist.

**CAPSTONE OUTPUTS**

* Charter, MGPP, risk register, comms plan.
* CTQ matrix, QFD, spec sheets, DOE notebooks, ANOVA/RSM summaries.
* DFMEA with actions closed. Control plan embedded in CLI and daemon.
* Pilot report with capability, stability, and audit packs.

**ANALOGIES**

* Git is the kanban board and the factory ledger. Commits are work units; refs are conveyors; notes are certificates.
* Locks are andons; receipts are travelers. Templates are jigs; composables are fixtures.

**CLOSING ASSERTION**

* A Git-native, Lean Six Sigma–designed engine turns invisible developer “dark matter” into measured, auditable flow with minimal variance and maximal trust.
