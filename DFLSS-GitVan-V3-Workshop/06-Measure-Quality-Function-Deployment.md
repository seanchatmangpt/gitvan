# Measure: Quality Function Deployment (QFD)

## The House of Quality for GitVan v3.0

Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a structured method for translating customer needs into technical requirements. The primary tool of QFD is the **House of Quality**, a matrix that connects what customers want to how we are going to achieve it. This ensures that our technical efforts are directly focused on delivering customer value.

For GitVan v3.0, the QFD helps us connect the Voice of the Customer (VoC) to the specific technical features and architectural decisions of the project.

### GitVan v3.0 House of Quality

| Technical Requirements (The "Hows") | Self-Learning System | Multi-Model AI Support | Microservices Architecture | Web Dashboard | Test Coverage > 95% | Startup Time < 2s | **Customer Importance (1-5)** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Customer Needs (The "Whats")** | | | | | | | |
| **An intelligent, autonomous tool** | 9 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | **5** |
| **A powerful, capable tool** | 3 | 9 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | **5** |
| **A reliable and stable tool** | 1 | 1 | 9 | 3 | 9 | 3 | **4** |
| **An easy-to-use tool** | 3 | 1 | 1 | 9 | 1 | 3 | **3** |
| **A fast, performant tool** | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 9 | **4** |

### How to Read the House of Quality:

1.  **Customer Needs (The "Whats"):** The rows of the matrix represent the key customer needs we identified from our VoC analysis. We've also assigned an **importance rating** to each need from the customer's perspective (1=Low, 5=High).

2.  **Technical Requirements (The "Hows"):** The columns represent the specific technical features or architectural decisions we are planning for v3.0. These are the levers we can pull to satisfy the customer needs.

3.  **Relationship Matrix (The Body):** The central part of the matrix shows the strength of the relationship between each customer need and each technical requirement. We use a 9-3-1-0 scale:
    *   **9 (Strong Relationship):** The technical requirement is a primary driver for meeting the customer need.
    *   **3 (Medium Relationship):** The technical requirement has a moderate impact.
    *   **1 (Weak Relationship):** The technical requirement has a minor or indirect impact.
    *   **0 (No Relationship):** There is no direct relationship.

### Analysis of the GitVan v3.0 House of Quality:

*   **High-Impact Technical Requirements:** By summing the columns (multiplying the relationship value by the customer importance), we can identify the most critical technical features.
    *   **Multi-Model AI Support:** (3*5) + (9*5) + (1*4) + (1*3) + (1*4) = 15 + 45 + 4 + 3 + 4 = **71**
    *   **Self-Learning System:** (9*5) + (3*5) + (1*4) + (3*3) + (1*4) = 45 + 15 + 4 + 9 + 4 = **77**
    *   **Microservices Architecture:** (3*5) + (3*5) + (9*4) + (1*3) + (3*4) = 15 + 15 + 36 + 3 + 12 = **81**
    *   **Test Coverage > 95%:** (0*5) + (3*5) + (9*4) + (1*3) + (3*4) = 0 + 15 + 36 + 3 + 12 = **66**

*   **Key Insights:**
    1.  The **Microservices Architecture** has the highest importance score (81). This is because it strongly impacts "Reliability and Stability," which is a highly-rated customer need, while also moderately impacting all other needs.
    2.  The **Self-Learning System** (77) and **Multi-Model AI Support** (71) are also critically important, as they are the primary drivers for the top two customer needs: an intelligent and powerful tool.
    3.  The **Web Dashboard** is important for making the tool "Easy-to-use," but it has less impact on the other core needs.
    4.  **Test Coverage** is a strong driver for reliability, but less so for the other customer requirements.

### The Roof: Correlation Matrix

The "roof" of the house shows the correlation between the technical requirements themselves.

| | Self-Learning | Multi-Model AI | Microservices | Web Dashboard |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Self-Learning** | | ++ | + | + |
| **Multi-Model AI** | ++ | | + | + |
| **Microservices** | + | + | | ++ |
| **Web Dashboard** | + | + | ++ | | 

*   **++ (Strong Positive):** These features are synergistic. For example, a Microservices architecture makes it easier to build a Web Dashboard.
*   **+ (Positive):** These features support each other.
*   **- (Negative):** These features may conflict. (None identified here).

**Insight:** There are strong positive correlations between our technical requirements, suggesting a well-aligned architectural vision. For example, the microservices architecture will make it easier to implement both the AI features and the web dashboard independently.

### Conclusion

The House of Quality provides a clear, data-driven justification for our technical strategy. It confirms that our planned features like the **Microservices Architecture**, **Self-Learning System**, and **Multi-Model AI Support** are the most critical levers for satisfying our customers' most important needs. This gives us confidence to proceed with these architectural pillars as we move into the **Explore** and **Develop** phases.
